# Changelog

## [0.8.62-alpha] - 2026-08-13
- **Dependency security: `league/commonmark` 2.8.3→2.10.0, closing six advisories of which exactly one reaches this application.** Six advisories against `league/commonmark` were published on 2026-08-06 — four days after [0.8.61](#0861-alpha---2026-08-02) took the lock to 2.8.3 — and the weekly [`deps-audit`](.github/workflows/deps-audit.yml) run went red on 2026-08-10. All six are fixed in 2.9.0; the lock and the committed `vendor/` tree go to 2.10.0, and `composer audit --locked` is clean again.
  - **The gate added in [0.8.60](#0860-alpha---2026-08-01) did the thing it was built for.** It stayed armed through the ~60-day scheduled-workflow dormancy window that entry warned about, and it caught a real advisory on the one package that entry singled out as *the* escaping layer of the Markdown path. The dormancy insurance was not theatre.
  - **Triaged against the code, not counted off the advisory list.** [`lunaTools::markdown()`](luna/luna.classes/luna.tools.class.php) builds a `GithubFlavoredMarkdownConverter`, which registers exactly five extensions — Autolink, DisallowedRawHtml, Strikethrough, Table, TaskList — and nothing else in the application constructs an `Environment`. So of the six, **one reaches this application**: CVE-2026-71488, quadratic-time denial of service in the core parser (`>=0.6.0,<2.9.0`). The other five need what is not registered: `AttributesExtension` (CVE-2026-71478, the href/src unsafe-link filter bypass, and GHSA-g2gp-3wwq-f4ph), `FootnoteExtension` (GHSA-jfm3-95jq-q3rf), the slug path reachable only from `HeadingPermalink` and `Footnote` (GHSA-mh25-x5hq-wrqp), and the XML renderer, which no first-party code calls (GHSA-mj63-m3rc-8ppr). Established by reading the vendored tree, not inferred from the advisory titles.
  - **The one that lands is a parser DoS, not an escaping defect** — a distinction that matters here specifically. The Markdown path is emitted with `disable-output-escaping` and is the one input deliberately exempt from the HTMLPurifier pass, so an escaping regression in this package would have been the serious shape. None of the six is one, and the escaping behaviour is unmoved.
  - **Output-neutrality proved twice, with the instrument checked before it was trusted.** The render baseline is gitignored and therefore per-checkout, so a stale one would have lied quietly: a fresh baseline was captured at 2.8.3 and then re-checked with nothing changed at all — 18/18 identical. Only that control makes a later "identical" carry information. After the bump: 18/18 byte-identical again.
  - **A second A/B on the library itself**, because page-level identity is thin evidence for a Markdown renderer — the seeded pages exercise only a fraction of the grammar. The converter was run over 45 constructs at both versions: headings, nested and loose lists, GFM tables/task lists/strikethrough, fenced and indented code, raw HTML including `script` and `iframe`, entities, Unicode, `javascript:`/`data:`/`vbscript:` and control-byte-obfuscated links, deep nesting, and the syntax of the unregistered Attributes and Footnote extensions. All 45 byte-identical.
  - **A caveat on the harness, recorded rather than glossed.** The control above was run with an extra capture-time assertion — that the harness's admin session actually authenticated before any baseline is written. Without it, `render-capture` can record a *failed* run as a valid baseline: observed during this work, a degraded capture wrote all eight admin-authenticated pages as 404 bodies, wrote `home_admin` as the guest homepage, and still reported `HTTP 200` for each and exited 0. That hardening is not in this release. Until it lands, treat a `render-check` pass as evidence only if the capture behind its baseline is known to have authenticated — the quick tell is that `test/render-baseline/home_admin.html` must not be byte-identical to `home.html`.
  - **Also verified before promoting:** `composer audit --locked` clean on the new lock, `php -l` clean on PHP 8.3 across first-party code, `docker-compose config -q`, and the smoke/security-regression, delegated-admin and admin-lockout suites green against a running stack.

## [0.8.61-alpha] - 2026-08-02
- **Dependencies: bring the three trailing packages current, and prove the Markdown renderer's output did not move.** [0.8.60](#0860-alpha---2026-08-01) recorded three packages one patch behind upstream with no advisory attached. Updated now so the safety margin on `league/commonmark` is deliberate rather than an accident of when the lock was taken: **`league/commonmark` 2.8.2→2.8.3**, **`nette/utils` v4.1.4→v4.1.5**, **`symfony/deprecation-contracts` v3.7.0→v3.7.1** (lock + committed `vendor/` tree; `nette/utils` v4.1.5 adds `src/Utils/DateTimeImmutable.php`).
  - **Output-neutrality proved by A/B, not assumed.** `commonmark` renders every page's Markdown, so a patch bump is exactly where a silent rendering regression would hide. An existing `make render-check` run was not usable as evidence — it reported 15 differing pages *before* this change too, because the local baseline (`test/render-baseline/` is gitignored, so it is per-checkout) predated 0.8.55–0.8.59, where outbound links and JSON-LD `sameAs` legitimately moved the output. So a fresh baseline was captured on the pre-change tree at 2.8.2 and re-checked at 2.8.3: **all pages byte-identical**.
  - **Verified against a live stack** before promoting, per convention: `php -l` clean on PHP 8.3; `composer audit --locked` reports no advisories on the new lock; the smoke + security-regression suite, the delegated-admin authz suite and the admin-lockout guardrail suite all green.
  - Note on `make render-check`: its baseline is gitignored and therefore local to each checkout. If yours predates 0.8.55 it will report false diffs until you re-capture it — and re-capturing is a deliberate call, since that reference is what the model-retirement work is measured against.

## [0.8.60-alpha] - 2026-08-01
- **Dependency security: audit the Composer tree continuously, and document what the audit cannot see.** The Markdown content path is emitted with `disable-output-escaping` and is the one input deliberately exempt from the HTMLPurifier pass, so [`league/commonmark`](docs/security.md) is not *a* layer of the XSS defence there — it is *the* layer. Nothing in the project checked whether it, or anything else under `vendor/`, carried a published advisory; the lock had gone six weeks unexamined. This closes that, and is honest about the two gaps it leaves open.
  - **Audit result: clean.** No published advisory affects any of the nine locked packages at their pinned versions. Recorded because the margin was one patch release: `league/commonmark` is pinned at **2.8.2** and CVE-2026-33347 (embed-extension `allowed_domains` bypass) affects `>=2.3.0,<=2.8.1`. Three packages sit one patch behind upstream (`league/commonmark` 2.8.2→2.8.3, `nette/utils` v4.1.4→v4.1.5, `symfony/deprecation-contracts` v3.7.0→v3.7.1) with no advisory attached — hygiene, not exposure.
  - **New [`deps-audit`](.github/workflows/deps-audit.yml) workflow** — `composer audit --locked` on every push and pull request **and on a weekly schedule**. The schedule is the substance of it: this project's intended resting state is dormant, so a push-triggered check alone would fall silent exactly while advisory risk accumulates. Kept out of `ci.yml` so a cron run doesn't boot the whole Docker stack; `--abandoned=report` keeps unmaintained-package notices informational (a maintenance signal, not a vulnerability) while security advisories fail the job.
  - **Verified in both directions.** A gate only ever observed passing is an untested gate, so it was proved to fail as well as pass: on a throwaway branch `league/commonmark` was pinned back to 2.8.0 and the workflow dispatched — it reported CVE-2026-33347 and CVE-2026-30838 and exited non-zero. Branch deleted; the lock is unchanged at 2.8.2.
  - **Two gaps written into [security.md](docs/security.md) rather than left implied by a green check.** (1) The in-tree vendored RDF library (`luna/luna.lib/arc`, semsol/arc2 3.1.0 with local PHP-8 patches) is not a Composer package, so **no advisory feed covers it and none will** — and it is *not* triplestore-only as its previous doc placement suggested: `lunaModel::dump()` calls its RDF/XML, Turtle, N-Triples and RDF-JSON **serialisers** on the ordinary content-negotiation path, live on the public MySQL-only profile with `SPARQL_ENABLED=0`. The exposure shape there is serialisation of author-written content into RDF syntax — an escaping defect would mean triple injection into the Linked Data representation, not code execution; its Turtle **parser** reads only the curated on-disk `semantic/links.ttl`, never remote input. (2) GitHub disables scheduled workflows after ~60 days of repository inactivity, so this dormancy insurance is itself subject to dormancy — after a long quiet spell, confirm the schedule is still armed.

## [0.8.59-alpha] - 2026-07-02
- **Security ship-gate: close the SQL injection in `link()`, fix the IPv6 throttle/session collapse, pin a canonical identity base (`SITE_URI`), and fix the CI readiness race.** Four independently small, independently verified fixes promoted together:
  - **SQL injection in [`lunaModel::link()`](luna/luna.classes/luna.model.class.php) closed.** The array branch interpolated a raw `$_POST` node id into `INSERT … VALUES` behind an `is_integer(intval($nid))` guard — a tautology (`intval()` always returns an int). Both endpoints are now `intval()`-cast before interpolation, matching the siblings (`unlink`/`update`/`delete`) that already quote or cast. Reached from the admin/editor mods with raw `$_POST`, CSRF-gated — so it was authenticated privilege escalation (editor → arbitrary SQL), not anonymous RCE; still, it goes.
  - **IPv6 throttle/session-binding collapse fixed.** [`lunaTools::encode_ip()`](luna/luna.classes/luna.tools.class.php) returned the constant `'00000000'` for every non-IPv4 client, so on a dual-stack host **all IPv6 clients shared one login-throttle bucket** (a griefable login-DoS) **and one session-IP binding** (hijack protection collapsed to the client-controlled User-Agent). Non-IPv4 addresses now map to a distinct, stable 8-hex token (`sha256` prefix) that fits `session_ip varchar(8)` — no schema change; IPv4 packing is byte-identical so `decode_ip()` display still works. Documented in [security.md](docs/security.md).
  - **`SITE_URI` — the canonical identity base, configurable at last.** `luna::$site_uri` was derived per-request from the `Host` header and fed the `/id/{slug}` IRIs, JSON-LD `@id`, `canonical`/`Link` headers and the sitemap — so the base half of every "forever" URI depended on an unvalidated request header, contradicting the *freeze the URIs* rule (and letting an admin write under an attacker-chosen `Host` mint triples under an attacker-chosen base). A configured `SITE_URI` (env or `.htaccess SetEnv`, via `luna_env()`) now pins the base for everything the app mints; unset, behaviour is unchanged (Host-derived, right for localhost dev). Forwarded through `docker-compose.yml`; documented with `SPARQL_ENABLED` / `TRUST_PROXY` in [configuration.md](docs/configuration.md). Verified at runtime: with `SITE_URI` set, `/data`, the JSON-LD `@id` and the `/id/root` 303 all use the pinned base; unset reverts to Host-derived.
  - **CI readiness race fixed at the root** (the cause of every red run since the regression job landed): the workflow waited for HTTP 200 while MySQL was still importing the seed, so DB-backed checks ran against an empty database. The `db` service now has a `luna_nodes`-aware healthcheck, `app` waits on `condition: service_healthy`, and the CI wait gates on real seeded content (the site footer) instead of a bare 200.
  - Verified before promoting: `php -l` clean (PHP 8.3) across first-party code; `docker compose config -q`; the full regression, delegated-admin and admin-lockout suites green against the running stack; IPv4 round-trips and two IPv6 addresses produce distinct tokens.

## [0.8.58-alpha] - 2026-06-23
- **Page-tree integrity: refuse a re-parent that would make a page its own ancestor (a cycle).** A cyclic `parent_nid` makes the parent-chain walk in `calculate_aliases()` / `get_children_nodes()` non-terminating — it would hang the request. The admin Pages form *tried* to prevent this, but its check used `get_children_nids()`, which only reliably returns **direct** children: the recursive `get_children_nodes()` nests deeper descendants into sub-arrays that `get_nid()` then drops, so re-parenting a page under its own **grandchild** slipped through and created a cycle. Fixed at the right layer:
  - New [`lunaModel::would_create_cycle($nid, $parent_nid)`](luna/luna.classes/luna.model.class.php) — a loop-safe transitive walk up the parent chain (it carries a visited set, so it terminates and reports a cycle even if the stored tree already contains one).
  - [`lunaModel::update()`](luna/luna.classes/luna.model.class.php) now refuses a cyclic re-parent **at the model layer** — the single choke point every caller passes through — logging and returning `false`, mirroring the existing immutable-slug and protected-node refusals.
  - [`mod_admin_pages::submit_modify`](luna/luna.mods/luna.mod_admin_pages.php) uses the same check, so a deep re-parent is now caught with the existing "hierarchy is incorrect" message instead of silently corrupting the tree.
  - Verified: `would_create_cycle()` unit-tested against the seed tree (self / direct-child / transitive-depth-2 / legitimate moves / arg guards — 7/7); an end-to-end check confirms `update()` refuses the cyclic and self-parent moves and leaves the tree unchanged; the regression, delegated-admin and admin-lockout suites stay green; `php -l` clean on PHP 8.3.

## [0.8.57-alpha] - 2026-06-23
- **Prep a real public deploy of the publishing surface (shared hosting / DreamHost): no-triplestore SQL profile, HTTPS hardening, sitemap, deploy runbook.** The dereferenceable, content-negotiated publishing surface (HTML + RDF + JSON-LD + `/id` + `/data`) is projected from MySQL in PHP, so it runs on ordinary PHP/MySQL hosting with **no triplestore**. This makes that deployment a first-class, hardened path.
  - **`SPARQL_ENABLED` master switch** ([luna.php](luna/luna.php); env or `.htaccess SetEnv`, default on). `0` disables the whole triplestore layer — read path *and* write-through (`sparql_reads` / `sparql_select` / `sparql_update` all short-circuit) — so a shared-hosting deploy serves entirely from MySQL with no failed reach for an endpoint that isn't there. Verified: with `SPARQL_ENABLED=0` the home page, `/data/root` (outbound `sameAs` still projected from MySQL) and `/sitemap.xml` all serve `200`.
  - **HTTPS correctness + hardening.** Centralised detection (`luna_is_https()` — `$_SERVER['HTTPS']` / port 443, plus `X-Forwarded-Proto` **only** when `TRUST_PROXY=1`, so it can't be spoofed on a directly-served host) now drives the canonical scheme (`site_uri`), the `Secure` flag on session + preference cookies, and a conditional **HSTS** (`Strict-Transport-Security`, 1 year + `includeSubDomains`) and CSP `upgrade-insecure-requests` — emitted only on HTTPS (verified absent on local http, so it can't brick the localhost stack).
  - **Crawler discovery.** `/sitemap.xml` lists the public page tree (ACL-scoped to the anonymous crawler's visibility; `login`/`logout` excluded) and `/robots.txt` points at it with a host-correct absolute URL (`lunaModel::emit_sitemap()` / `emit_robots()`). Removed the stale 2010 static `robots.txt` that shadowed the dynamic route.
  - **Deploy aids.** New `bin/preflight.php` checks a host can run the surface (PHP ≥ 8.1; `xsl` / `pdo_mysql` / `mbstring` / `gettext` / `json` / `libxml`; vendor tree; writable cache). `.htaccess` gains commented force-HTTPS + canonical-host blocks. Config reads now honour `.htaccess SetEnv` through a getenv-∪-`$_SERVER` helper (`luna_env()`), so a shared host with no shell env can still configure the app.
  - **Docs.** Rewrote [going-public.md](docs/going-public.md) into a shared-hosting deploy runbook (two shapes — localhost full stack vs. public publishing surface); the README warning now distinguishes the two and links it; [installation.md](docs/installation.md) gains an "Option C — public shared hosting" pointer and the full extension list; [security.md](docs/security.md) documents the public-deploy posture (HSTS, `SPARQL_ENABLED=0`, the deploy checklist); [linked-data.md](docs/linked-data.md) notes the surface is triplestore-independent.
  - Full security/regression suite green; `php -l` clean on PHP 8.3.

## [0.8.56-alpha] - 2026-06-23
- **Docs — bring [docs/try-it.md](docs/try-it.md) current with the content-negotiation / Linked Data surface.** The tour predated P4 + outbound links: its "same page, three ways" section showed only `?output=` and it never mentioned content negotiation, the dereferenceable `/id` and `/data` URIs, Turtle, or the outbound `sameAs`/`seeAlso` links. Rewrote §1 around real HTTP `Accept` negotiation (HTML / Turtle / JSON-LD / RDF-XML off one URL, `?output=` noted as the address-bar alias); added a `/id` (`303`) and `/data` section that also shows the outbound links and the `/data/admin` → `404` ACL parity; folded Turtle into the formats. **Removed the standalone federation walkthrough** — the `SERVICE`-to-Ontop query fails in the default hardened compose (Oxigraph is network-isolated to `sparql-proxy` only), so it was never copy-paste-true here; it stays in [examples/queries.sparql](examples/queries.sparql), which documents the network caveat, and the tour now points there. Every remaining command re-run against the live stack to confirm it's copy-paste-true.

## [0.8.55-alpha] - 2026-06-23
- **Link out — the graph stops being an island: operator-curated outbound links (`owl:sameAs` / `schema:sameAs` / `rdfs:seeAlso` / `schema:about`).** P4 (0.8.54) made the graph *dereferenceable*; on its own that is still a well-formed graph that links to *nothing*. The whole point of the Semantic Web is the boundary-crossing — a consumer (increasingly, an agent) following its nose from a LunarSystem page out to an external entity, and external datasets pointing back in. This adds that outbound surface.
  - **New [`semantic/links.ttl`](semantic/links.ttl)** — a curated Turtle file of statements that connect this site's resources to the wider web. Subjects are **relative `/id/` IRIs** (`<root>`, `<welcome>`, …, i.e. a content slug), so the file is **deployment-independent**: they resolve against the live `{site}/id/` base when projected, working unchanged on localhost and in production. Honest seed examples — the home page `schema:sameAs` / `rdfs:seeAlso` the project repository, the welcome article `schema:about` the project — with copy-paste patterns for `owl:sameAs` to Wikidata / `schema:sameAs` to ORCID.
  - **[`lunaModel::outbound_index()`](luna/luna.classes/luna.model.class.php)** parses the file once per request (ARC2 Turtle parser, relative IRIs resolved against `{site}/id/`; a missing/unparseable file is a silent no-op) and the statements are merged into **every published representation** of the named resource: `?output=turtle/xml/json` and the dereferenceable `/data/{slug}` document (via `build_schema_index()`), and the embedded + `?output=jsonld` JSON-LD (via `to_jsonld()` — schema.org predicates compact to bare terms like `"sameAs"`, other vocabularies keep their full-IRI key, still valid JSON-LD).
  - **[`lunaModel::rdf_load_links()`](luna/luna.classes/luna.model.class.php)** mirrors the same statements into the triplestore with a SPARQL `INSERT DATA` at the end of `rdf_resync_all()`, so **`make resync-triplestore`** keeps a direct SPARQL query consistent with the published `/data` + JSON-LD projections (idempotent, best-effort).
  - **Tests:** `test/regression.sh` gains a **"Linked Data"** section — content negotiation (`/` as HTML vs. Turtle), `/id/root` `303` both ways (→ HTML doc, → `/data/root`), `/data/root` `200`, `/data/admin` guest `404` (ACL), `Vary: Accept`, and the outbound `sameAs` in both Turtle and JSON-LD. Verified end-to-end against the running stack (the triplestore SPARQL query returns all three seed links after a resync); full suite green; `php -l` clean on PHP 8.3.

## [0.8.54-alpha] - 2026-06-23
- **P4 (part 1) — the server is now a content-negotiated Linked Data surface: real HTTP `Accept` negotiation + dereferenceable `/id/{slug}` and `/data/{slug}` URIs + Turtle.** The graph was already well-modelled but sealed: an internal-only SPARQL endpoint, `?output=` the only way to get RDF out, no dereferenceable identity URIs. This opens the doors — the same canonical URL now serves HTML to a browser and RDF to a Linked Data client, and every resource has an identity URI that dereferences. Server-side `XSLTProcessor` stays the one canonical renderer (the dropped client-side-XSLT decision is unchanged).
  - **HTTP `Accept` content negotiation** in [`lunaTools::set_output_format()`](luna/luna.classes/luna.tools.class.php) via a new `negotiate_output_format()`. The same URL (`/`, `/journal`, …) serves `text/html` to a browser and `text/turtle` / `application/ld+json` / `application/rdf+xml` / `application/n-triples` / `application/rdf+json` to an RDF client, chosen by a q-value-aware parse of `Accept`. Precedence: an explicit `?output=` / path suffix (debug aliases) **>** `Accept` **>** the HTML default. Safety rails: only `GET`/`HEAD` negotiate and **never** an XHR (admin AJAX injects HTML fragments and must not be handed RDF); a bare `*/*` or a missing header keeps HTML; `application/xml` is deliberately **not** offered (browsers send it at `q=0.9` and must not get RDF — RDF/XML is offered as `application/rdf+xml` only). `Vary: Accept` is now sent on every response so a cache never hands an RDF client the cached HTML, or vice-versa.
  - **Dereferenceable resource URIs (Cool URIs / `httpRange-14`)** in a new [`luna::route_linked_data()`](luna/luna.php). `/id/{slug}` is the resource **identity** — it returns no content itself, it **`303 See Other`s** to a concrete document: the HTML page for a browser, the RDF `/data/{slug}` for an RDF client, by the negotiated format. `/data/{slug}` is the RDF **document** — Turtle / JSON-LD / RDF-XML by negotiation, **never** HTML (defaults to Turtle), re-entering the normal pipeline against the resource's alias so its texts load and the serialiser emits the same graph as `?output=`. Both resolve the slug against the **ACL-filtered** graph, so a resource the current user can't see `404`s exactly as the HTML view does.
  - **Turtle output is now real** — `text/turtle` via ARC2's `getTurtleSerializer`, added to `luna::$output_formats` and `lunaModel::dump()`. (The placeholder `turtle` serializer that 0.8.53 *removed* from the docs as non-existent is now actually implemented.)
  - **`Link` headers advertise the trail** ([`lunaTools::send_alternate_links()`](luna/luna.classes/luna.tools.class.php)): every page carries `Link: <…/id/{slug}>; rel="canonical"` plus `rel="alternate"` to the RDF document (from an HTML page) or to the HTML page (from a data document), and `rel="describedby"`. A consumer can follow its nose from any representation to the identity and across to the others.
  - New helpers: `lunaTools::negotiate_output_format()` / `redirect()` (303-default) / `send_alternate_links()`; `lunaModel::get_node_from_slug()` (ACL-scoped slug→node) / `get_alias()`.
  - **Verified end-to-end** against the running stack: content negotiation (`/` → HTML for a browser, Turtle for `Accept: text/turtle`, JSON-LD for `Accept: application/ld+json`); `/id/root` `303`s to `/` for HTML and to `/data/root` for RDF; `/data/root` `200`s as Turtle with the `Link` trail; ACL preserved both ways (guest `/data/admin` → `404`, authenticated admin → `200`; guest `/admin` → `404` unchanged); `?output=*` debug aliases still work. The full security/regression suite stays green; `php -l` clean on PHP 8.3.
  - **Remaining P4 (deferred, with reason):** backing the RDF representation with a SPARQL `CONSTRUCT`/`DESCRIBE` instead of the PHP `build_schema_index()` projection is **not** done — it's blocked on a `schema:name` overload. `rdf_sync_node()` writes a page's `schema:name` as the **raw slug** (the SPARQL router reads `schema:name` *as* the slug), while `build_schema_index()` emits `schema:name` as the **humanised `rdfs:label`** — so swapping the serialiser to a `CONSTRUCT` would regress published page names from "Admin Journal" to "admin_journal". Reconciling that overload (a distinct routing key vs. display name) is its own change plus a triplestore reseed; tracked in [roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md). Also deferred: `/id` and `/data` resolve **pages** only — a text/`Article` slug (e.g. `/id/welcome`) `404`s today and is described inside its page's `/data` document.

## [0.8.53-alpha] - 2026-06-23
- **Docs — full pass to make every doc/readme current and free of useless historical narrative.** Went through all 16 `docs/`, the root readmes/meta files, and the SPARQL examples, stripping the "how we got here" narration — version-stamped change records, audit-process storytelling, and migration narratives ("previously X, now Y") — in favour of clean current-state description. The detailed history stays in this CHANGELOG, which is the archive (and was left untouched). Highlights:
  - **[docs/security.md](docs/security.md)** cut from a version-stamped hardening record (the "fixed in 0.7.x/0.8.x" tables and the adversarial-review narratives) down to a current-posture doc: controls in place, residual limitations, the SPARQL surface, and deploy guidance.
  - **[docs/going-public.md](docs/going-public.md)** reframed from a done/not-done readiness checklist into a lean "safety & scope" note (no committed secrets, loopback-only, deliberate non-goals).
  - **[docs/linked-data.md](docs/linked-data.md)** and **[docs/why-rdf.md](docs/why-rdf.md)** lost the Phase-0/A/B/C migration-progress framing; the design and rationale are kept.
  - **Accuracy fixes found by verifying prose against code:** the architecture error-handling section described a `DEBUG`/`IS_ADMIN` branch and a `lunaTools::debug()` that do not exist (rewritten to the real always-JSON `lunaLog::log()` path); [database-schema.md](docs/database-schema.md) was missing the `luna_login_throttle` table and the `luna_sessions.csrf_token` column and showed `DEBUG = 1` (the default is `0`); [configuration.md](docs/configuration.md) now documents the real `db.ini`-or-`DB_*`-env precedence; a non-existent `turtle` serializer was dropped from rdf-model.md; assorted stale line refs and the `calculate_aliases()` framing were corrected.
  - **RDF census corrected from a live re-measure.** The seed shrank (texts 2 → 1 welcome block) but the documented counts never followed. Measured against a fresh rebuild: the default Oxigraph store (resync) holds **140 triples** with **WebPage 13 / Article 1 / Person 2** (docs said "~152 / 14 / 2"), and the Ontop materialise emits **98 triples** (docs said "104"). Fixed in [try-it.md](docs/try-it.md), [why-rdf.md](docs/why-rdf.md), [linked-data.md](docs/linked-data.md), and [examples/queries.sparql](examples/queries.sparql).
  - Verified cross-doc link integrity (anchors and file targets resolve).

## [0.8.52-alpha] - 2026-06-22
- **Docs — rewrite the roadmap to be forward-looking.** [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md) had accreted long retrospectives of finished work (the full P0/P1 "done" write-ups) and a multi-paragraph essay justifying the dropped client-side-XSLT goal — burying the actual plan under a record of the past. Trimmed to what's *ahead*: **P2** (retire the MySQL content write — must-succeed dual-write + outbox, optimistic concurrency, atomic cutover, slug-as-identity), **P3** (named graphs / inference / SHACL), **P4** (data-first server with HTTP `Accept` content negotiation), plus the five still-open decisions. P0/P1 and slug-immutability are now a one-line "done so far"; the dropped P5 is a single note; resolved decisions are a footnote; the stale `v0.8.47-alpha` pin is gone. No plan was dropped — verified P2/P3/P4 are genuinely unbuilt before trimming (dual-write still best-effort, `luna_nodes_seq`/`nextID()` still mints ids, no `Accept` negotiation in `set_output_format`). Cut ~65% (2,460 → 930 words).

## [0.8.51-alpha] - 2026-06-22
Two fixes for the same class of bug — things that worked only because of local-only state on the maintainer's machine and would break on a fresh public clone / in CI — plus a small styling tweak.
- **Fix: a fresh clone could not boot — `db.ini` is gitignored and was never provisioned (broke clone-and-run + CI).** The DB credentials live in `luna.default/ini/db.ini`, which `.gitignore` excludes (correctly — it can hold real creds) and which nothing in the repo creates; `lunaDB::prepare()` hard-threw `"cannot find the database configuration file"` when it was absent. It only worked locally because the maintainer had an untracked `db.ini`. So `docker-compose up` on a fresh clone booted the containers and then died on the first request. The README and installation docs even promised the file "already points at the Docker defaults" — untrue after a clone. Fixed by giving `prepare()` an **environment fallback** mirroring the existing `SPARQL_*` pattern in luna.php: an explicit `db.ini` still wins (manual / per-domain installs), but when it's absent the app reads `DB_HOST`/`DB_NAME`/`DB_USER`/`DB_PASS` from the environment, and `docker-compose.yml` now passes those to the `app` service (defaults `db` / `lunadb` / `luna` / `luna`, matching the `db` service and overridable via a gitignored `.env`). These are the same non-secret demo values already in `docker-compose.yml` in plaintext. Verified end to end: with **no `db.ini` present**, a fresh `docker-compose up` connects and serves pages; with a `db.ini` present it still takes precedence. Docs (`README.md`, `docs/installation.md`, `.env.example`) corrected to match. PHP `-l` clean on PHP 8.3.
- **Fix: the test suite, CI readiness probe and render harness referenced an `/about` page that the seed never creates.** `test/regression.sh` (smoke block), the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` "wait for the app to render" gate, and `test/render_diff.sh` (the page-capture list, including the four `?output=` RDF-format captures) all hit `GET /about` and expected `200`. But `about` is **not a seeded node** (the seed's pages are `root`, `login`, `node`, the admin screens, …; the only seeded content is the home `welcome` text) — it only ever existed in the maintainer's long-lived local DB volume, so on a fresh `down -v` / clean checkout `/about` is a `404` and the CI `regression` job would hang on the readiness gate and then fail the smoke assertion. Repointed every reference at pages that **are** in the seed: the readiness probe and smoke check now use `/` and `/node`; the render harness captures `/node` for the standard-template page and `/` (which carries the welcome `schema:Article`) for the four output formats. No seed change, so the documented RDF census is untouched. Verified against the running stack via the SQL read path (what CI uses): `/`, `/node`, `/login` and all four home `?output=` formats return `200`.
- **Styling — align content list items to the baseline grid.** `#Content-main li` now gets the baseline-grid mixin (`bg.set()`), emitting the `li:before`/`li:after` spacer rules in the compiled `css/luna.css`, so bulleted/numbered lists in page content sit on the same vertical rhythm as body text. Also removed some commented-out dead rules in `scss/_base.scss` and `scss/_page.scss`.

## [0.8.50-alpha] - 2026-06-22
- **Seed a Markdown welcome text on the home page, so a fresh install is not blank.** `luna.mysql.sql` now ships one demo text block — a "Welcome to LunarSystem" intro written in Markdown (headings, bold, a list, inline `code`, a link) attached to the home (`root`) page. The seed rows mirror exactly what `mod_edit_texts` writes when a text is created in the UI: a `text` node (`nid 33` — the free slot before `luna_nodes_seq`, which still allocates the next id as 34), the page link (both `luna_nodes_map` directions), an author/timestamp `luna_actions` row, and the `luna_texts` row. It renders to HTML on the home page (via the SPARQL→SQL read fallback, since a fresh Oxigraph is empty), while `?output=*` keeps the Markdown source in `luna:content` and the stripped plain text in `schema:articleBody`. Remove the clearly-commented block from the seed for a content-free install.
- **Fix: the seed importer mangled UTF-8 (multibyte content double-encoded into mojibake).** The mysql client — including Docker's `docker-entrypoint-initdb.d` importer — connects as **latin1** by default, so the welcome text's em-dashes were stored as `â€"` rather than `—`. Added `SET NAMES utf8mb4;` at the top of `luna.mysql.sql` so the session reads the file as UTF-8. Verified on a real `down -v && up`: the em-dash stores as `E28094` and renders cleanly. Also future-proofs any accented/i18n seed content.

## [0.8.49-alpha] - 2026-06-22
- **Fix: a fresh install could not import the seed under utf8mb4 (fresh Docker boots were broken).** The Compose `db` service runs MySQL with `--character-set-server=utf8mb4`, but `luna_nodes.lid` and `luna_types.lid` were `varchar(255)` with a **UNIQUE** key — 255×4 = 1020 bytes, over MyISAM's 1000-byte key limit — so `docker-entrypoint-initdb.d` aborted at the `luna_nodes` CREATE and the database came up empty (the app then couldn't connect). Existing volumes survived only because they were initialised earlier under utf8mb3 (765-byte key). Shrunk both `lid` columns (and `luna_config.name`, a non-unique key that was silently prefix-truncated) to **`varchar(191)`** — the standard utf8mb4 index-length fix (191×4 = 764 < 1000) — keeping the full-Unicode server default. Slugs/keys are short, so no practical length loss. Verified end to end with the real `mysql:8.0` entrypoint + the exact Compose command: the seed now imports cleanly and the fresh database has **zero text rows and zero text nodes** (no leftover HTML content — content authoring is Markdown since 0.8.48). FULLTEXT keys (`luna_nodes.lid`, `luna_texts(content,title)`, `luna_users(firstname,lastname)`) were never subject to the limit and are unchanged. Pre-existing volumes keep working; to match the seed, optionally `ALTER TABLE luna_nodes MODIFY lid VARCHAR(191); ALTER TABLE luna_types MODIFY lid VARCHAR(191); ALTER TABLE luna_config MODIFY name VARCHAR(191);`.

## [0.8.48-alpha] - 2026-06-22
- **Page content is now authored in Markdown, not raw HTML.** The `mod_edit_texts` editor textarea holds **Markdown source** (it was a plain textarea into which admins hand-wrote HTML). Markdown is the canonical, stored, and *published* form: `luna:content` carries the Markdown source verbatim (so `?output=xml/n3/json/jsonld` and the triplestore are portable source text, and re-editing round-trips the source), while HTML is generated for the **HTML view only**.
  - **Rendering.** `lunaModel::project_to_schema()` (the `transform()` serialisation boundary that feeds the XSLT) now emits a transient `ui:content` literal per `schema:Article` — the article's `luna:content` Markdown rendered to HTML. `luna.default.html.xsl` / `luna.root.html.xsl` emit that `ui:content` with `disable-output-escaping` instead of the old raw `luna:content`. `ui:content` lives in the `ui:` render namespace and never reaches the published graph (`build_schema_index()`/`to_jsonld()`/`rdf_sync_node()` project from `$this->index`, not from `project_to_schema`), so `?output=*` stays Markdown.
  - **Renderer + safety.** New Composer dependency **league/commonmark 2.8.2** (GitHub-flavoured: tables, task lists, strikethrough, autolinks), wrapped as `lunaTools::markdown()` / `markdown_to_text()`. Configured `html_input=escape` + `allow_unsafe_links=false`, so raw HTML in the source is **escaped** and `javascript:`/`data:` URIs are dropped *by construction* — the output is safe to `disable-output-escaping` without a second pass. The Markdown content field is therefore **exempt** from the global HTMLPurifier input pass (`lunaTools::sanitize_inputs()` keeps it raw; purifying reflows whitespace and strips Markdown punctuation); every other input still goes through HTMLPurifier. The source is never disable-output-escaped (only `ui:content` is) and is XML-escaped when echoed back into the textarea.
  - **`schema:articleBody`** is now the genuine plain-text projection: Markdown → HTML → strip tags (`markdown_to_text()`), in `build_schema_index()`, `to_jsonld()` and `rdf_sync_node()` — instead of `strip_tags()` over raw markup.
  - **Schema.** `luna_texts.content_html` → **`content`** (`longtext`; the column held HTML, now holds Markdown — the name was a misnomer and now matches the `luna:content` term). Updated across `luna.mysql.sql` (column + FULLTEXT index), `mod_edit_texts` INSERT/UPDATE, every model SELECT + internal array key, and the Ontop **R2RML** mapping (`semantic/ontop/mapping.ttl`). **Breaking** for an existing database: `ALTER TABLE luna_texts CHANGE content_html content LONGTEXT;` (then rebuild the FULLTEXT index). The shipped seed has no text rows, so a fresh `docker compose up` is unaffected.
  - **Editor.** The forminput `wysiwyg` flag/class (a dead hook — there was never a WYSIWYG editor, and `.wysiwyg` had no CSS) is renamed to `markdown`; a "Written in Markdown" hint sits under the content field in both the add and modify forms.
  - **Docs/ontology** brought current: `luna:content` is documented as Markdown source (security, templating, rdf-model, database-schema, modules, ontology trio, third-party notices). PHP `-l` clean on PHP 8.3.

## [0.8.47-alpha] - 2026-06-22
- **Three pre-existing render-model XSLT bugs fixed (surfaced during the Phase-4 `ui:` migration, but predating it).** All in `luna/luna.xsl/luna.html.xsl/`. (1) **Journal log-analyse field labels** — `luna.journal.html.xsl` looked up each field's i18n label with `name()`, which yields the *prefixed* QName (`ui:message`), while the journal mod registers *bare* msgids (`message`, `code`, `date`). The lookup always missed and the `<xsl:otherwise>` printed the raw QName. Changed `name()` → `local-name()` so `$name='message'` matches; the registered fields now resolve to their translated labels (`lid`/`content` stay bare — they were never registered, a separate latent gap). (2) **`Jump to page` vocabulary lookup** — `luna.common.html.xsl`'s `quickjump` template selected `ui:vocabulary[ui:lid = 'Jump to page']` *without* the trailing `/ui:value`, so it rendered the node's whole string-value (lid **+** value concatenated) instead of the translated string; added the missing `/ui:value`. (3) **Unquoted XPath string literal** — `luna.admin_groups.html.xsl` tested `ui:message[ui:code = warning]`, where bare `warning` is a child-element node-test, not the string `'warning'`; the "Add a group" box therefore never auto-expanded on a validation warning. Quoted it to `[ui:code = 'warning']` (matching its already-correct sibling). All three verified by isolated `XSLTProcessor` proofs (QName→resolved label; concatenated→value-only; never-expands→expands-on-warning). **Render byte-identical** across the harness; regression + delegated-admin + admin-lockout suites pass. The render-diff harness gained a permanent guard for the journal analyse view (`test/render_diff.sh` seeds a deterministic `luna_logs` row + captures `/admin/journal?log_id=999`), which previously sat outside the strict page set.

## [0.8.46-alpha] - 2026-06-22
- **Docs sync — every doc, readme and the front-facing ontology brought current with the completed Phase 0-4 migration.** Audited all 27 markdown files + the `ontology/` trio (`ontology.ttl`, `index.html`, `README.md`) against the code. Removed the now-false "the clean schema.org graph is only the published projection; the internal in-memory model is still `/node/{nid}` / `owl:isChildOf` / `luna:is_active`" narrative — there is one model now (the XSLT renders from the same schema.org + `/id/{slug}` graph). Documented the new `ui:` render-model namespace (`https://jeromev.github.io/LunarSystem/render#`) in the ontology front-page and `ontology.ttl`. Fixed vocabulary mappings, the `15` (not 16) `xmlns:luna` stylesheet count, stale function/line anchors, and the same stale narrative in `lunaModel::build_schema_index()`'s docblock. SQL `is_active` column references and legitimate migration-history narratives were correctly left intact. Render byte-identical; no behavioural change.

## [0.8.45-alpha] - 2026-06-22
- **Legacy-model retirement, Phase 4 — the UI render-model gets its own `ui:` namespace.** The render-scaffolding (i18n `vocabulary`, form/list `data`, `pager`, request echo `request`, flash `message`, journal `log`, language/`output-format` switchers, `config`) is moved out of the content `luna:` namespace into `ui:` = `https://jeromev.github.io/LunarSystem/render#`. The whole move is one ~8-line edit at the single producer chokepoint `lunaModel::load_var()` (every render bnode predicate/type → `ui:`); the 16 stylesheets read `ui:` (730 render-term renames + the contextual `ui:host`-rooted `luna:lid`/`logserver` reads), with `xmlns:ui` + `exclude-result-prefixes="ui"` so it never leaks onto `<html>`. This **dissolves the local-name collisions** (`lid`, `content`, `value`, `code`) that previously distinguished content from UI only by host element: the namespace IRI now denotes which world a term belongs to. **Isolation proven:** `?output=xml/n3/json/jsonld` are byte-identical before/after — the render-model never reaches the published graph (`load_var` bnodes fail `build_schema_index`'s content gate; `project_to_schema` re-keys only `/node/` IRIs). Render byte-identical across the harness; regression + admin-lockout + delegated suites pass. The journal log-analyse view (a `name()`-driven admin tool, not in the strict harness) was manually verified: it renders, and its already-broken field-label i18n now falls back to `ui:*` QNames instead of `luna:*` (a pre-existing mismatch; its fix is tracked separately). Content stays `luna:` for the genuinely app-specific terms (`lid`/slug, `isActive`, `level`, `alias`, `content`/HTML, `url`, runtime flags, group/level/mod types).

## [0.8.44-alpha] - 2026-06-22
- **Legacy-model retirement, Phase 3d — keep `luna:content` (raw HTML) app-specific.** Phase 3a had renamed the rendered `luna:content` → `schema:articleBody`, but that put *HTML markup* under a property whose published value is *stripped plain text* — the same predicate carrying two different values across projections. Reverted: the rendered graph keeps `luna:content` (the raw HTML the renderer needs; schema.org has no HTML-body term, so it is genuinely app-specific, like `luna:lid`/`luna:alias`), and `schema:articleBody` is reserved for the published clean-text projection in `build_schema_index`/`to_jsonld`. Rendered + published now agree on `luna:content`, with `schema:articleBody` as the published enrichment. Render byte-identical; suites pass.

## [0.8.43-alpha] - 2026-06-22
- **Legacy-model retirement, Phase 3c — schema.org content *types*.** The boundary projection now re-types the rendered graph: `rdf:type luna:page` → `schema:WebPage`, `luna:text` → `schema:Article`, and the text→page membership predicate `luna:page` → `schema:isPartOf` (joining the page→parent `isPartOf` already in place since Phase 1). The 16 stylesheets select the standard classes (54 `luna:page` → `schema:WebPage`, 10 `luna:text` → `schema:Article`, 4 membership reads → `schema:isPartOf`), with word-boundary matching so the render-model term `luna:pager` is left intact. Users are already `foaf:Person`; group/level/mod keep their `luna:` type (no standard equivalent), as does the UI render-model (`luna:vocabulary`/`data`/`pager`/`request` — a later separation). The rendered content graph is now schema.org-typed end to end: pages are `schema:WebPage`, texts are `schema:Article` with `schema:articleBody` + `schema:headline`/`name`, both `schema:identifier`, both linked by `schema:isPartOf`. Render byte-identical; regression + admin-lockout + delegated suites pass.

## [0.8.42-alpha] - 2026-06-22
- **Legacy-model retirement, Phase 3b — `schema:name` for the rendered label.** The boundary projection now maps `rdfs:label` → `schema:name`, so the 16 stylesheets read the standard name property (45 references) uniformly — no fragile per-type classification in the XSLT. For parity the published projections (`build_schema_index`, `to_jsonld`) now also carry `schema:name` on articles alongside the existing `schema:headline`, so both the rendered graph and `?output=*` agree on `schema:name` while articles keep the richer headline. Rendered HTML byte-identical (the only output deltas are the intended `schema:name` triple in `?output=*` and the embedded JSON-LD); regression + admin-lockout suites pass.

## [0.8.41-alpha] - 2026-06-22
- **Legacy-model retirement, Phase 3a — schema.org predicates (`identifier`, `articleBody`).** Extended the serialisation-boundary projection (`lunaModel::project_to_slug` → `project_to_schema`) with a predicate map that swaps app-specific terms for standard schema.org ones where an equivalent exists: `luna:nid` → `schema:identifier`, `luna:content` → `schema:articleBody`. The 16 HTML stylesheets now read the standard predicates (88 + 7 references). `luna:lid` (the URL slug), `luna:isActive`, `luna:level` and `luna:alias` stay luna: — they are genuinely app-specific and have no standard equivalent. Render byte-identical; regression + admin-lockout suites pass.

## [0.8.40-alpha] - 2026-06-22
- **Legacy-model retirement, Phase 2 — `/id/{slug}` identity for the rendered graph.** The document the XSLT consumes is now keyed on `/id/{slug}` instead of `/node/{nid}`. New `lunaModel::project_to_slug()` re-keys the working index at the serialisation boundary in `transform()` — every `<base/node/{nid}>` subject and node-valued `@rdf:resource` becomes `<base/id/{lid}>` — mirroring the projection `build_schema_index()` already does for `?output=*`. The loaders keep building in nid-space (the relational FKs *are* nid-based) and `nid` survives as the `luna:nid` property the admin forms post, so the accessors, routing/aliases and write paths are untouched. Verified: `project_to_slug` produces `/id/{slug}` subjects + re-pointed `isPartOf` links (reflection); the render-diff harness is byte-identical **except** a benign, deterministic reordering of one admin "levels" list — now lid-alphabetical, because ARC2 serialises subjects in URI order, where `/id/level_admin…` sorts alphabetically vs the old `/node/6…` numeric order; `?output=*` stays `/id/{slug}`; regression + admin-lockout + delegated suites pass; **no rendered HTML carries a `/node/{nid}` URI**. The legacy integer identity is gone from the graph everyone sees. (Phase 3: full schema.org typing — `luna:page` → `schema:WebPage`, etc.)

## [0.8.39-alpha] - 2026-06-22
- **Legacy-model retirement, Phase 1 — vocab oddities.** Renamed the two embarrassing legacy terms in the *internal* in-memory model and the 15 XSLT stylesheets that read them: snake-case `luna:is_active` → `luna:isActive` (matching the triplestore), and the **non-existent** `owl:isChildOf` → the standard `schema:isPartOf` (added `schema:` to the model's namespace set). Only the RDF *predicates* were renamed — never the `is_active` DB column. Verified strictly output-neutral by the new render-diff harness (every page byte-identical after each rename) plus the regression + admin-lockout suites; `owl:isChildOf` and `luna:is_active` are now **gone from all RDF output** (xml/n3/json/jsonld), and the RDF/XML serialisation gained the proper `schema:` prefix (was the auto-generated `ns0:`). Harness refinements: normalise version strings + relative times; drop the externally-polluted journal log-viewer from the strict diff. (`/node/{nid}` identity → Phase 2; full schema.org typing → Phase 3.)

## [0.8.38-alpha] - 2026-06-22
- **Render-diff harness — Phase 0 of retiring the legacy in-memory model.** New [`test/render_diff.sh`](test/render_diff.sh) (`make render-capture` / `make render-check`) snapshots the normalised HTML + RDF render of 19 page types (public pages, all admin screens, the four `?output=` formats, guest + logged-in) and asserts byte-identical output across runs — normalising CSRF tokens, timings, relative dates, log ids and live online-session state. It's the safety net for the upcoming model migration: every step that changes the in-memory model or the XSLT must keep the render byte-identical (verified stable: 19/19 pages SAME across repeated runs). Baselines are gitignored (regenerate with `make render-capture`). Goal of the migration: the XSLT renders from the same clean schema.org/slug graph as the triplestore — one model, `/id/{slug}` identity, no `owl:isChildOf`/`luna:is_active`/`/node/{nid}`.

## [0.8.37-alpha] - 2026-06-22
- **RDF — `?output=xml/n3/json` now serve the clean schema.org projection.** They used to dump the raw in-memory model — `/node/{nid}` integer-identity URIs, `owl:isChildOf` (a non-existent OWL term) and snake-case `luna:is_active`, plus render scaffolding. New [`lunaModel::build_schema_index()`](luna/luna.classes/luna.model.class.php) projects the page + its text blocks into the **same** standards-based shape as `?output=jsonld` and the triplestore: `/id/{slug}` IRIs, `schema:WebPage`/`Article`, `schema:isPartOf`/`hasPart`, typed literals, and just the three custom terms (`luna:isActive`/`level`/`content`). `dump()` serialises that for the three RDF formats; the legacy in-memory model (which drives the XSLT navigation via `owl:isChildOf`) and the `mod_node` node-dump path are untouched. Verified: the legacy terms are gone from all three formats, the published predicate set is **parity-exact** with the triplestore, the HTML still renders, and the regression + admin-lockout suites pass. (The full internal-model rename stays a deliberate P2.) Updated the ontology + docs notes that described the old behaviour.

## [0.8.36-alpha] - 2026-06-22
- **GitHub Pages root landing.** The vocabulary already dereferenced at `jeromev.github.io/LunarSystem/ontology/`, but the bare Pages root 404'd. Added a static `index.html` landing (links to the ontology, repo, docs, changelog) plus `DirectoryIndex index.php` in `.htaccess` so the app keeps serving `index.php` for `/` — GitHub Pages serves the static landing, Apache never does. Verified the app still renders `/` correctly.

## [0.8.35-alpha] - 2026-06-22
- **Ontology review + GitHub Pages prep.** Reviewed the aged `luna:` vocabulary. Finding: the persisted/queryable ontology (triplestore + R2RML) is already modern and minimal — only **three** custom terms (`luna:isActive`, `luna:level`, `luna:content`); everything else is schema.org + FOAF, with slug IRIs and `schema:isPartOf`. What is dated is the legacy `?output=xml/n3/json` serialization, which mirrors the internal XSLT model and still emits the old conventions — `owl:isChildOf` (a non-existent OWL term), `/node/{nid}` integer-identity URIs, and snake-case `luna:is_active`. Those terms are load-bearing for the XSLT navigation (the menu is built from `luna:page[owl:isChildOf …]`), so aligning that path with the clean triplestore projection is a roadmap-scale change (part of P2), not a quick rename. Corrected the published `ontology.ttl` + `index.html` to document the three canonical terms accurately (the initial scaffold had over-listed internal/legacy terms); validated the Turtle parses (18 triples). Added `.nojekyll` so GitHub Pages serves the vocabulary as static files (no Jekyll build to fail).

## [0.8.34-alpha] - 2026-06-22
- **RDF — moved the `luna:` ontology namespace to GitHub Pages and centralised it.** With `lunarsystem.org` gone, the vocabulary namespace needed a new base. Chose **`https://jeromev.github.io/LunarSystem/ontology#`** (GitHub Pages) over the bare repo URL: a namespace IRI should be a stable identifier you can *serve a vocabulary from*, and the repo URL doesn't dereference to RDF and conflates "where the code lives" with "what the vocabulary is." Three URI roles are now kept distinct — the **vocabulary** namespace (project-level, this change), **resource/instance** IRIs (`/id/{slug}`, which already follow the deployment host via `luna::$site_uri`), and the project **homepage** (`github.com/jeromev/LunarSystem`, the `@link` tags). Centralised the namespace to a single source of truth, `lunaModel::LUNA_NS` — the `$lunaNameSpace` property and all three inline SPARQL `PREFIX luna:` reads now derive from it (was four scattered literals). Migrated all 21 sites that repeat it (the 16 XSLT `xmlns:luna` declarations, `semantic/ontop/mapping.ttl`, `examples/queries.sparql`, four docs) and re-projected the triplestore (`make resync-triplestore`). Verified: every output format (`xml`/`n3`/`json`/`jsonld`) carries the new IRI with zero stale refs, the HTML renders (XSLT still matches the model's RDF), and SPARQL vs SQL read parity is identical (17/17). Added a starter vocabulary under [`ontology/`](ontology/) (`ontology.ttl` + `index.html` + a README on enabling Pages so the IRI dereferences); documented the three-roles principle in `docs/linked-data.md`.

## [0.8.33-alpha] - 2026-06-22
- **Docs — cleaned to present-state; `CHANGELOG.md` is the canonical history.** A multi-agent audit inventoried historical archaeology and facts left stale by the night's work; the fixes were applied across 16 files. Removed the removal-narrative and version-pinned asides the docs had accumulated — e.g. "jQuery has been removed", the CKEditor / PEAR-MDB2 / Cache_Lite removal trails, and "as of 0.5.0-alpha" / "since 0.3.3-alpha" pins — so the docs now describe how things ARE, not how they changed. Corrected facts that went stale earlier tonight: `Cache_Lite` → `lunaCache`, `luna/luna.lib/` → `luna/luna.lib/arc/`, the moved locale path, the vendored-libs list, and a stale `v0.8.22` in the roadmap. THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES dropped paragraphs for assets that no longer exist (jQuery, jQuery TreeView, CKEditor) and now lists only what ships: the locally-patched in-tree ARC2 and the one Composer dependency, HTMLPurifier. **History-file decision:** no new history file — `CHANGELOG.md` is the chronological record and the docs point to it. The one doc that deliberately keeps a historical narrative is `docs/security.md`: its hardening tables are a security **audit trail** (what was fixed and how — genuinely useful for review), the justified case for keeping history; it now leads with current posture and its present-state sections were de-pinned.

## [0.8.32-alpha] - 2026-06-22
- **i18n — locale catalogs moved under `luna.domains/<domain>/locale/` (per-domain local data).** Localization is site-local data, so it now lives beside the other per-domain data (`ini/`, `cache/`) rather than in a shared engine directory. The gettext tree moved from `luna/luna.locale/` to `luna/luna.domains/luna.default/locale/`; `set_language()` now binds both the engine `luna` catalog and the git-ignored, site-specific `local` overrides to the **active** domain's `locale/` when it ships one, falling back to the default domain's catalogs (the `LOCALE_PATH` ini default) otherwise — so a new domain can localize itself by dropping in its own `locale/`, with no engine change. The `local` catalog (`local.po`/`local.mo`) stays git-ignored, now matched per-domain. Verified: `en_US` and `fr_FR` both still translate from the new path (the French login page renders “Mot de passe”/“Connexion”, English renders “Password”/“Login”), and the regression suite is green. Docs (README tree, configuration.md, the locale README) updated.

## [0.8.31-alpha] - 2026-06-22
- **Dependencies — evaluated moving ARC2 to Composer; kept it vendored, with corrected provenance.** The bundled-libs cleanup left one in-tree library, **semsol/arc2**; the obvious next step was to source it via Composer like HTMLPurifier. Tried exactly that (installed Packagist `semsol/arc2 3.1.0`, autoloaded it, dropped `luna.lib/`) and it **broke `?output=n3` (HTTP 500)**: the vendored copy is *not* pristine 3.1.0. It carries a local **PHP-8 patch** — stock 3.1.0's N-Triples serializer calls `preg_match()` on an array term and throws a `TypeError` on luna's index — plus a **UTF-8** escaping fix (the stock ISO-8859-1 round-trip mangles multibyte characters). Neither is upstream, and ARC2 is dormant (3.1.0 is the latest release), so the patches will not be upstreamed. **Conclusion: ARC2 is the textbook case *for* vendoring** — a dead dependency we must patch — the opposite of HTMLPurifier (maintained + unmodified, rightly on Composer). It stays in `luna/luna.lib/arc/`; the Composer move was reverted (no code change). The `VENDOR.txt` that wrongly claimed the copy was unmodified was corrected to document the two patches, and THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES / security.md now flag ARC2 as locally PHP-8/UTF-8 patched. The lesson: the principle is “Composer for maintained + unmodified deps, vendor for patched + dormant ones,” not “everything via Composer.”

## [0.8.30-alpha] - 2026-06-22
- **Security — admin-lockout guardrails.** The admin tier reaches the admin UI through a single chain — a user in `group_admin` -> which grants `level_admin` -> which gates the admin pages/modules — so one careless edit can lock **every** administrator out of a running site. This happened: the sole admin unticked their own `group_admin` membership in the user editor and lost all access (restored by re-inserting the membership edge + resyncing the triplestore). A multi-agent audit enumerated 20 candidate self-harm scenarios and adversarially verified each; **four were real, reachable lockouts**, now closed: (1) `mod_admin_users::submit_modify` refuses to drop the actor's own admin membership or the last **active** administrator; (2) `submit_delete` refuses to delete the last admin user; (3) `mod_admin_pages::submit_delete` and (4) `mod_admin_mods::submit_delete`/`submit_modify` gained the protected-lid guard their sibling handlers already had (the pages/mods that power the admin UI can no longer be deleted, relevelled or deactivated). As **defence-in-depth**, `lunaModel::delete()` now refuses to delete any node whose lid is in the central `luna::$protected_lids` set — extended from the admin pages to also cover `group_admin`/`group_default`, `level_admin`/`level_public` and the admin modules — so even a future handler that forgets the check cannot remove a structural node. New `lunaTools::active_admin_count()` backs the count-based 'never leave zero admins' invariant. Verified by a new [`test/admin_lockout.sh`](test/admin_lockout.sh) (`make test-lockout`, also folded into `make test`): it asserts all four vectors are blocked for the shipped single admin while ordinary user create/delete still works, and the regression + delegated-admin suites stay green.

## [0.8.29-alpha] - 2026-06-22
- **Dependencies — replace PEAR Cache_Lite with a native file cache; retire PEAR base (libs cleanup, phase 3).** The page/model cache backend is now a small native [`lunaCache`](luna/luna.classes/luna.cache.class.php) (a keyed file store under the cache dir with a `filemtime` TTL and atomic-rename writes) instead of the abandoned PEAR **Cache_Lite**. The app only ever used Cache_Lite as a dumb string store (`get`/`save`/`clean`, with its own `serialize`/`unserialize(..., ['allowed_classes'=>false])` guard around values), so `lunaCache` is a drop-in for that exact surface — including Cache_Lite's quirk that `save()` without an id reuses the last `get()`'s id. This removes the **last consumer of PEAR base**, so `PEAR.php`/`PEAR5.php` are deleted too — **ARC2 is now the only vendored in-tree library**. Also dropped the now-dead `magic_quotes_runtime` polyfill in `luna.php` (it existed solely for Cache_Lite; nothing else calls those PHP-8-removed functions). A native cache is the right call here — unlike the HTMLPurifier swap — because a file store is trivial and stable, not a security boundary that benefits from a maintained Composer dependency. Verified: `lunaCache` round-trips (miss / hit / last-id save / TTL expiry / clean); with `CACHE=1` a guest page load writes 4 cache entries and the warm load serves **byte-identical** HTML; the ARC2 `?output=xml` path still works without the polyfill; and the regression + delegated-admin suites pass. Docs (README, security.md, THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES) updated.

## [0.8.28-alpha] - 2026-06-22
- **Security — replace the legacy HTML_Safe sanitiser with HTMLPurifier (libs cleanup, phase 2; a real XSS-hardening upgrade).** `lunaTools::sanitize()` — which `sanitize_inputs()` runs over every scalar in `$_GET/$_POST/$_COOKIE/$_SESSION/$_REQUEST` on every request — now uses **HTMLPurifier 4.19** (via Composer) instead of the abandoned ~2005 PEAR **HTML_Safe** denylist parser. HTMLPurifier parses to a real DOM and emits only an explicit allowlist of safe tags/attributes/URI schemes, so `<script>`, SVG/MathML, `on*` event handlers and `javascript:` URIs are dropped **by construction** — the SVG-SMIL `<animate>` bypass HTML_Safe had to be hand-patched against (0.7.5/0.8.1) is closed for free, along with unknown future denylist-evasion vectors. A single HTMLPurifier instance is built once and cached (its serializer cache in a writable temp dir), so the blanket per-input sanitisation stays fast (warm requests ~13 ms; a multi-field login POST ~80 ms). This adds the project's **first Composer dependency** (`composer.json` + committed `vendor/`; HTMLPurifier has no runtime deps, so the app stays clone-and-run). Removed the vendored **HTML_Safe** and **XML_HTMLSax3** (its now-orphaned SAX parser); `PEAR.php`/`PEAR5.php` are kept — still Cache_Lite's lazy error-path fallback (→ phase 3). Verified: the real `sanitize()` strips script / SVG-SMIL / `on*` / `javascript:` while preserving formatting and safe links, the app boots, and the regression + delegated-admin suites pass. The stored-content/WYSIWYG XSS residual is upgraded from a hand-maintained denylist to an allowlist parser. Docs (README, security.md, THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES) updated.

## [0.8.27-alpha] - 2026-06-21
- **Dependencies — drop the vendored PEAR Log library + dead code (libs cleanup, phase 0–1).** Following the bundled-library audit: removed `luna/luna.lib/Log.php` (834 lines) entirely. The app only ever used PEAR Log's ~8 `PEAR_LOG_*` integer priority constants (the severity codes across ~120 call sites) plus `Log::priorityToString()` (two call sites in the journal) — never the Log factory/handlers (logging has gone straight to `luna_logs` via PDO since the MDB2 removal). Those constants are now defined inline in [`luna.classes/luna.log.class.php`](luna/luna.classes/luna.log.class.php) (the stable syslog levels 0–7), and a new `lunaLog::priorityToString()` (identical labels, passed through `_()` for i18n) replaces the PEAR call in [`mod_journal`](luna/luna.mods/luna.mod_journal.php). Also removed the **dead Turtle serializer branch** in `luna.model.class.php` (`turtle` is not in `$output_formats`). PEAR base (`PEAR.php`/`PEAR5.php`) is **kept for now** — it is the lazy error-path fallback that Cache_Lite and XML_HTMLSax3 `include` on failure, so it goes away with them (phases 2–3), not here. Verified: pages render with no undefined-constant errors, `priorityToString` returns the exact legacy labels (emergency…debug / unknown), the journal shows priority labels, and the regression + delegated-admin suites pass. Docs (README, security.md, THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES) updated.

## [0.8.26-alpha] - 2026-06-21
- **Security — audited the hand-rolled SPARQL string assembly; no injection path found.** Closes the one remaining "audit before trusting" caution in [docs/security.md](docs/security.md). The write-through (`rdf_sync_node`/`rdf_delete_node`/`rdf_resync_all`) and the read builders (`load_nodes_sparql`/`load_texts_sparql`) assemble SPARQL by interpolation, but every user-controlled value flows through `rdf_str()` (= `sparql_literal()`, escaping `\ " \n \r \t` with backslash first — the characters that break a double-quoted literal — wrapped in quotes), `rdf_uri()` (`rawurlencode`d lid, so no IRIREF-breaking character can escape `<…>`), or `rdf_int()` (`intval`), around an otherwise static query. Verified both by static review of every call site and by **live break-out probes** against the running triplestore using the actual escapers: a value engineered to close the literal and smuggle a second `INSERT DATA`, and a lid engineered to break the IRI, were each stored as inert data — the injected `<urn:INJECTED>` / `<urn:INJECTED2>` triples never appeared (`ASK → false`), while the payload itself round-tripped verbatim. No code change required; the security note is updated from "treat as injection surface / audit before trusting" to **audited injection-safe**.

## [0.8.25-alpha] - 2026-06-21
- **Layout/typography — regularise the responsive type scales and land the box-handle baseline fix.** All seven per-breakpoint font-size scales in `scss/_scales.scss` now follow the **same progression as `$m`** (14/16/18/21/25/32/42): each is `round(base × $m / 14)` anchored on its existing `note` size (12→18, +1 per breakpoint), so every row increases and every size grows monotonically `xs→ul` — replacing the previous ad-hoc, non-monotonic values. The `.box-handle` collapse/expand triangle is now a **background image** instead of a `::before` glyph (committed earlier in source): the baseline grid (`bg.set`/`bg.scale`) reserves both `::before` and `::after` on every heading for its empty-content grid struts, so the glyph in `::before` had broken the snap — the compiled CSS catches up here and headings sit on the grid again. Also in this pass: the header language/format switchers use `display: flex; align-items: baseline` (`_page.scss`); self-closing tags normalised in the XSLT/ARC2 templates (`<… />` → `<…/>`); and the baseline-grid **debug overlay is left ON** (`$debug: 1` in `_bg.scss`) for ongoing layout work — set it back to `0` before any real deploy. Lagging current-version badges (why-rdf / security / linked-data) realigned to the release.

## [0.8.24-alpha] - 2026-06-21
- **Triplestore — make `rdf_resync_all()` runnable as `make resync-triplestore`, and realign the example census to that canonical rebuild.** Several docs (linked-data / why-rdf / roadmap) referenced `lunaModel::rdf_resync_all()` as the way to "rebuild the store from MySQL", but it had **no caller anywhere** and only *upserted* (it left graph-only orphans behind). Now: a new [`bin/resync-triplestore.php`](bin/resync-triplestore.php) CLI entry does a minimal non-web bootstrap and calls the model; a new `make resync-triplestore` target wraps `docker-compose exec -T app php bin/resync-triplestore.php`. The rebuild is a **true reset**: `rdf_resync_all($prune = true)` first clears the whole graph via a new **`rdf_clear()`** (`DELETE WHERE { ?s ?p ?o }`), then re-projects every node — so orphans are dropped, not just upserted (the default `$prune = false` keeps the old non-destructive reconcile behaviour). The model constructor gained a one-line **`LUNA_MAINTENANCE`** guard so a CLI task can obtain a bare model without the session-bound web read-model build. Verified: clear + re-project of all 35 seed nodes, app still renders from the rebuilt store (`/`, `/about`, `/login` → 200), `WebPage` parity with MySQL (14), and `make test` green. **Census realignment:** this pure-PHP projection is *fuller* than the Ontop materialise — it types **every** text `schema:Article` (not just the page-linked one) and projects the level/group/mod nodes too — so the default Oxigraph store it builds holds ~152 triples and shows **WebPage 14 / Article 2 / Person 2**. The illustrative counts in [`examples/queries.sparql`](examples/queries.sparql) and [`docs/try-it.md`](docs/try-it.md) are set back to those rebuild numbers (where they were before 0.8.23 aligned them to the thinner materialise), with the materialise's 104 / Article 1 noted as the Ontop-direct variant; [`docs/linked-data.md`](docs/linked-data.md)'s materialise step keeps its 104-triple count. try-it.md §2 now seeds the graph (`make resync-triplestore`) before the census, since the SQL-loaded seed leaves Oxigraph empty.

## [0.8.23-alpha] - 2026-06-21
- **Test — stop the delegated-admin test from orphaning triples in Oxigraph; correct stale example-census counts.** [`test/delegated_admin.sh`](test/delegated_admin.sh) creates its throwaway user through the admin UI (`POST /admin/admin_users` `mode=add`), which mirrors the new node into Oxigraph via the model's write-through — but `teardown()` deleted that user with raw `DELETE FROM luna_nodes/luna_users/luna_nodes_map` SQL, **bypassing the model**, so the node's mirrored triples (`a foaf:Person`, …) were never removed and accrued across every `make test` run (observed: the store drifting to 3 `foaf:Person` URIs vs MySQL's 2). `teardown()` now also evicts the user's triples from the triplestore through the authenticating `sparql-proxy` — `DELETE WHERE { <…/id/delegated%40test.local> ?p ?o } ; DELETE WHERE { ?s ?p <…> }`, mirroring `lunaModel::rdf_delete_node()` — via a new best-effort `rdf_purge()` helper (plus an `APP`/`APP_CONTAINER` var, now also used for the existing cache-clear). Verified: repeated runs leave the store **bounded** (no `delegated@test.local` triples remain; `foaf:Person` back to 2). Separately, the illustrative SPARQL-census counts were stale — a fresh Ontop materialise of the seed emits **104 triples** with **WebPage 14 / Person 2 / Article 1** (only one of the two seed texts is page-linked, so only one projects as a `schema:Article`), not the documented “97 triples” / “Article 2”: corrected in [`examples/queries.sparql`](examples/queries.sparql), [`docs/try-it.md`](docs/try-it.md), and [`docs/linked-data.md`](docs/linked-data.md). Query 3’s “6 siblings” re-verified correct (unchanged). No PHP/runtime change.

## [0.8.22-alpha] - 2026-06-21
- **Docs — comprehensive consistency pass: align every doc/readme with 0.8.21 and fix accumulated staleness.** A multi-agent audit swept all 26 markdown docs (plus `examples/queries.sparql`) against the code. Brought up to date: the **authenticated SPARQL proxy** (`sparql-proxy`, HTTP basic auth, internal-only Oxigraph) and **`SPARQL_AUTH_USER`/`SPARQL_AUTH_PASS`** now appear across installation / configuration / architecture / linked-data / try-it / going-public; the **per-target admin authz** completion is reflected wherever the security posture is summarized — including flipping the stale ⬜-open CSRF / session-fixation / submit-handler-privesc rows in `docs/security.md`'s status table to ✅ (all were fixed in 0.7.x–0.8.20); project-structure trees gained `semantic/sparql-proxy/`. Removed-host-port references (Oxigraph `7879`, Ontop `8081`) and direct `oxigraph:7878` query examples were rewritten to go through the proxy with credentials, including `examples/queries.sparql`. Also fixed pre-existing inaccuracies the audit surfaced: stale **PHP 5.3–5.6** runtime claims (PHP 8.3 since 0.5.0) in CONTRIBUTING and the issue/PR templates; a `varchar(32)` “unsalted MD5” `password` column (it is `varchar(255)` bcrypt); “serialised” / PEAR-Log log payloads (now JSON via a direct PDO INSERT); an “enable `session.use_trans_sid`” line (sessions are cookie-only); and broken `../docs/` links in an issue template. No code change; version badges bumped to 0.8.22-alpha (the 0.6.9–0.8.21 hardening-pass ranges are unchanged).

## [0.8.21-alpha] - 2026-06-21
- **Security — authenticate the SPARQL write endpoint behind a reverse proxy (closes the last residual).** Oxigraph has no native auth and its `/update` + `/store` accept unauthenticated writes. A new `sparql-proxy` (Caddy) now fronts it and demands **HTTP basic auth on every request** — reads and writes alike — before forwarding; Oxigraph is moved onto an **internal-only** compose network whose only other member is the proxy, so the triplestore is unreachable except through the authenticated proxy (the app can no longer reach `oxigraph:7878` directly). The app presents credentials via a new `sparql_auth_header()` on both the read (`sparql_select`) and write (`sparql_update`) paths, from `SPARQL_AUTH_USER`/`SPARQL_AUTH_PASS` (`luna.php`, via env). The proxy's bcrypt hash is generated at container start from the plaintext password, so **no password hash is committed**; the plaintext is a demo default (`.env.example`; gitignored `.env` for overrides). Verified end-to-end: an unauthenticated read or write to the proxy returns **401**, the app's authenticated reads/writes return 200/204, the app cannot reach Oxigraph directly (network-isolated), content still renders from the triplestore, and the regression + delegated-admin suites are green. Builds on 0.8.17 (no host port). Docs (README, security.md, linked-data.md) and the Oxigraph load step updated.

## [0.8.20-alpha] - 2026-06-21
- **Security — close the last two admin per-target authz gaps + add a delegated-admin escalation test (finishes B1).** Two submit handlers still skipped the per-target check: `admin_levels` *add* (the group-admission loop, which force-admits `group_admin`) now refuses — via `user_can_access_group` — to admit a group whose levels the actor does not hold; `admin_mods` *delete* now refuses — via `user_can_access_level` on the module's bound level (`get_level_node`) — to delete a module above the actor's access. All five admin modules now enforce per-target authz on every mutating path. New [`test/delegated_admin.sh`](test/delegated_admin.sh) (wired into `make test` / `make test-authz`) proves the deny path end-to-end: it manufactures a `level_edition`-only admin (re-binds the `admin` → `admin_groups` page + mod down to edition, creates a user in `group_edition`), then — as that user — attempts to grant `level_admin` to a group and asserts the guard **denies** it and writes no link, before tearing the scenario down. No-op for the shipped single-admin tier (regression green). Docs refreshed: the per-target gap is recorded as **resolved** in [docs/security.md](docs/security.md), and the stale “no per-target admin authz” / “CSP still allows `'unsafe-inline'`” / removed-host-port notes in the README are corrected.

## [0.8.19-alpha] - 2026-06-20
- **Data outputs carry only the content graph.** The machine-readable outputs (`?output=xml`/`json`/`n3`/`jsonld`) are now emitted **before** the HTML-only chrome is merged into the model, so they contain just the RDF content (pages, texts, access levels) — no session/site chrome. Gone from the data views: the site config + sort cookies + admin email (`<luna:data>`), the i18n labels (`<luna:vocabulary>`), the request params (`<luna:request>`), the current user (`<foaf:Person>`), and the language/format switchers. This supersedes the 0.8.18 csrf-token-only exclusion (reverted as redundant). HTML pages are unchanged (forms, nav, vocabulary intact); verified all four data formats are valid and chrome-free, the browser still renders the XML tree, and the regression suite is green.

## [0.8.18-alpha] - 2026-06-20
- **Fix — `?output=xml` rendered as a raw data dump (A3 regression) + CSRF-token leak in the data outputs.** The strict CSP from 0.8.16 (`style-src 'self'`) blocked Chrome's built-in XML/JSON viewer inline stylesheet, so the RDF/XML data outputs rendered as unstyled run-on text (all element text concatenated, including a query-looking `journal_sort {…}`) before the document tree. The non-HTML data responses (xml/json/n3/jsonld, emitted by `lunaModel::dump()`) now send a relaxed, data-appropriate CSP — `default-src 'none'; style-src 'unsafe-inline'; img-src data:` — so the browser viewer renders the tree, while **HTML pages keep the strict `script-src 'self'; style-src 'self'`**. Separately, those data outputs were serializing the whole `self::$data`, including the session **CSRF token** — now excluded from the machine-readable outputs (HTML forms still carry it). Verified in headless Chrome: zero CSP violations, the tree renders, and `csrf_token` no longer appears in `?output=xml`.

## [0.8.17-alpha] - 2026-06-20
- **Security — gate the unauthenticated SPARQL endpoint (B2).** Oxigraph and Ontop no longer publish a host port; they are reachable only on the internal compose network (by `app`), never from the host or a browser. This closes the **CSRF-to-localhost write vector** against Oxigraph's unauthenticated `/update` and `/store` (a malicious page could otherwise POST a SPARQL UPDATE to `localhost:7879` and corrupt the triplestore). The app is unaffected — it already used the internal `oxigraph:7878` / `ontop:8080` service names. Verified: the host ports are now refused while the app still reads from the triplestore (`ASK{}` → true, content renders) and the regression suite is green. Manual dev queries now go through the app container (`docker-compose exec app curl http://oxigraph:7878/query …`); docs updated.

## [0.8.16-alpha] - 2026-06-20
- **Security — drop CSP `'unsafe-inline'` (A3).** The admin UI's inline `onclick`/`onchange` handlers were externalized to **data-attributes** driven by event delegation in [js/luna.js](js/luna.js) — `[data-href]` navigable rows, `select[data-navigate]`, `select[data-submit-on-change]`, and `[data-confirm]` confirmations (16 handler sites across 9 XSL templates; the dead `confirmSubmit()` helper removed). With no inline handlers and no inline styles anywhere, the CSP tightens to **`script-src 'self'; style-src 'self'`** (no `'unsafe-inline'`). Verified with headless Chrome: **zero CSP violations** across all pages, row-click navigation / pager selects / delete confirmations all work, and the regression suite is green.

## [0.8.15-alpha] - 2026-06-20
- **Security — per-target authz in the remaining admin modules (finishes B1).** Extended the B1 pattern to the object-IDOR vectors: `admin_pages` (add/modify/delete), `admin_levels` (modify/delete) and `admin_mods` (add/modify) now refuse, via `lunaTools::user_can_access_level`, to bind a page/mod to — or modify/delete an object at — an access level the actor does not hold. Verified no-ops for the shipped admin (a page modify still succeeds; regression suite green). Latent in the single-admin config like the rest of the cluster.

## [0.8.14-alpha] - 2026-06-20
- **Security / UX — JSON log payloads + fix blank journal messages (B3).** `lunaLog::log()` now stores payloads as **JSON** instead of `serialize()`, so the journal read path never `unserialize()`s stored data — the object-injection sink is gone for all new logs. It also persists only a trimmed identity (`session_summary()` — firstname/lastname/email) instead of the whole session object (csrf token, levels, internals). The reader gained `decode_message()`: JSON first, with a guarded `unserialize(allowed_classes => ['lunaException','stdClass'])` fallback for pre-0.8.14 rows (transitional). This also **fixes the blank-message bug**: the earlier `allowed_classes => ['lunaException']` guard turned string-log `stdClass` payloads into `__PHP_Incomplete_Class`, so `->message` read blank — the journal list and detail now render the real messages (verified: 20 non-empty entries where there were 0, new JSON and legacy rows alike).

## [0.8.13-alpha] - 2026-06-20
- **Security — per-target authorization in the admin modules (B1).** `admin_users` and `admin_groups` linked arbitrary groups/levels to a user/group with no check the actor could access them — a privilege-escalation-via-assignment gap if admin is ever delegated to a lower tier (the two CRITICAL findings from the review's IDOR cluster; latent in the shipped single-admin config, now closed):
  - `admin_groups` (add + modify) denies granting any level the actor does not hold (`lunaTools::user_can_access_level`).
  - `admin_users` (add + modify) denies assigning any group that grants a level the actor does not hold, via a new `lunaTools::user_can_access_group()` helper (true iff the actor holds every level the group grants).
  - Verified no-ops for the shipped admin (holds all three levels): regression suite green, and an admin add-user-with-group still succeeds. `admin_pages`/`admin_levels`/`admin_mods` follow the same pattern at lower severity (object IDOR rather than privesc) — noted as remaining.

## [0.8.12-alpha] - 2026-06-20
- **CI — make the regression job deterministic.** The new `regression` job now boots only `app`+`db` with `SPARQL_READS=0` (SQL read path) instead of the full stack, so it doesn't depend on a populated Oxigraph triplestore. Verified the SQL path renders identically via the per-request `?sparql=0` toggle.

## [0.8.11-alpha] - 2026-06-20
- **Tooling — smoke + security-regression suite (C1).** Added `test/regression.sh` (run via `make test`) that exercises the 2026 hardening against a running stack: public-page smoke, case-insensitive source/secret denials (`.git`, docker files, `semantic/`, `db.ini`), security headers (CSP / X-Frame-Options / nosniff / no `X-Powered-By`), authentication (valid login, wrong-password rejection, **tokenless-login CSRF-gate rejection**), and the `load_texts` SQLi clamp (timed stacked `SLEEP`). Wired into CI as a new `regression` job that boots the stack and runs the suite. Also fixed the CI `php-lint` job to use `php:8.3-cli` (was `php:5.6-cli`, which fails on the codebase's PHP 7+ syntax).

## [0.8.10-alpha] - 2026-06-20
- **Accessibility pass (A2).** Audited every page with axe-core (WCAG 2 A/AA + best-practice) driving headless Chrome — the tree is now clean. Fixes:
  - Pager `<select>`s (page / per-page) get `aria-label`s (was a *critical* "select must have an accessible name").
  - In-text links are underlined (`p` / `dd` / `#Bottom`) so they're distinguishable without relying on colour.
  - Journal log-entry links get an `aria-label` (the message preview can render blank, which left an empty link with no name).
  - Colour contrast brought to AA: table `<th>` darkened (white text was ~1.3:1 on the `#e2e2e2` page), the pager strip text (`#999 → #555`), the brand link colour (`#cc007a → #be006f`, imperceptible) so links pass on striped rows, and inactive/deleted-row text (`#999 → #6a6a6a`).

## [0.8.9-alpha] - 2026-06-20
- **Layout — responsive pass across all pages (A1).** Verified every page type at 390px (mobile) and 1280px (desktop) with headless Chrome:
  - **Turned off the baseline-grid debug overlay** (`_bg.scss` `$debug: 1 → 0`) — it was shipping a visible grid overlay baked into `css/luna.css`.
  - **Fixed horizontal overflow on every authenticated page.** Wide admin data tables widened the whole grid on phones (admin reached 785px in a 390px viewport). Root-cause chain: grid items (`#Top`/`#Content`) defaulted to `min-width:auto` and fieldsets to `min-inline-size:min-content`, so a wide table's min-content propagated up to the `minmax(auto,1fr)` track. Now grid items + fieldsets use `min-width:0` and `.boxtable` is `overflow-x:auto`, so wide tables scroll inside their box instead of widening the page — all pages now fit 390px.
  - **Capped form fields/columns** (`input/textarea/select/.col/span.label { max-width:100%; box-sizing:border-box }`) so the fixed `bg.h()` widths never overflow; made `img` responsive.
  - **Footer toolbar fits phones** — the format/language switches were clipping the `jsonld` button under 480px; tightened gaps/padding.
  - Wrapped the `admin_groups` users table in `.boxtable` for consistency with the other admin tables.

## [0.8.8-alpha] - 2026-06-20
- **Removed the dead `en_EN` gettext locale.** The app standardised on `en-US` everywhere in 0.7.x — `lunaTools::format_language()` maps `en`→`US`, so `site_langs` (built from the DB `langs='en, fr'` config) resolves to `['en-US','fr-FR']`, and both the nav language switcher ([luna.php:560](luna/luna.php)) and `set_language()` only ever use those. Nothing produced, offered, or loaded `en_EN`/`en-EN`; 0.8.7 only marked it legacy in the docs. Now actually deleted:
  - `git rm -r luna/luna.locale/en_EN` (the whole `LC_MESSAGES/{luna,local}.{po,mo}` set; the git-ignored `local.*` files were removed from disk too).
  - Dropped the now-orphan `msgid "en-EN"` (→ `"English"`) from the remaining `en_US` and `fr_FR` `luna.po` catalogs — no source string ever looked it up (`_($lang)` is only called with full `en-US`/`fr-FR` tags) — and recompiled both `luna.mo`.
  - `Dockerfile` — removed the `localedef … en_EN.UTF-8` alias (and its comment) that existed only to satisfy the old `en`→`en_EN` mapping; the image now generates just `en_US.UTF-8` + `fr_FR.UTF-8`.
  - `README.md` — the locale tree line drops the "`en_EN` is a legacy locale" note.
  - Verified live on the Docker stack: the switcher still offers only English (`?lang=en-US`) and Français (`?lang=fr-FR`); `en-US` and `fr-FR` pages render with the correct `<html lang>` and gettext; a stale `?lang=en-EN` request still falls back cleanly (HTTP 200, no 404). No config or schema change.

## [0.8.7-alpha] - 2026-06-20
- **Docs — consistency pass (all 24 doc files + codebase audited against the 0.8.x state).** A multi-agent audit (8 areas; each finding verified against the code to separate genuine staleness from correct historical references) surfaced 11 real inconsistencies, now fixed:
  - `README.md` — the warning box and "Known issues" table no longer claim unsalted-MD5 / no-CSRF / `use_trans_sid=1` / missing `session_regenerate_id` (all fixed in 0.7.x); they now list the real residuals (unauthenticated SPARQL endpoint, no per-target admin authz, per-IP-only throttle). The directory tree drops the "jQuery from cdnjs" note and marks `en_EN` as a legacy locale.
  - `SECURITY.md` — reframed from "hardened in 0.2.14-alpha" to the 0.6.9–0.8.6 pass with residuals.
  - `CONTRIBUTING.md` + `docs/installation.md` — corrected PHP 5.6 / `php:5.6-apache` / `php:5.6-cli` → PHP 8.3 / `php:8.3-apache` / `php:8.3-cli` (matching the actual Dockerfile and lint).
  - `docs/going-public.md` — no longer lists CSRF / bcrypt / session-rotation as "deliberately not done" (they were done).
  - `docs/roadmap.md` + `docs/linked-data.md` — current-version bumped 0.5.0-alpha → 0.8.6.
  - `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` — records jQuery as removed (0.6.8-alpha); the front-end is now dependency-free vanilla JS.
  - `scss/README.md` — the partials table matches the actual tree (drops deleted `_clearfix`/`_tinymce`, adds `_init`/`_scales`/`_mixins`, de-jQuery's `_treeview`).

## [0.8.6-alpha] - 2026-06-20
- **Docs — second adversarial review results.** `docs/security.md` now records the post-0.8.4 multi-agent review (8 dimensions, two skeptics per finding): verdict **ship-with-low-risk**, the two real defects fixed in 0.8.5, and the documented residuals — chiefly that the admin modules perform no per-target authorization (safe as shipped because every admin page/mod is bound to the sole `level_admin` tier, but a latent privilege-escalation gap if admin is ever delegated to a lower level), plus the per-IP throttle's IP-rotation limitation and the unchanged UA-binding / `'unsafe-inline'` CSP.

## [0.8.5-alpha] - 2026-06-20
- **Security — second-review follow-ups (throttle race + journal deserialization).** A fresh 8-dimension adversarial review (each finding double-checked by an exploitability verifier and a refuter) graded the post-0.8.4 tree **ship-with-low-risk**. Two real defects fixed:
  - **Login-throttle TOCTOU (the one live finding).** The per-IP back-off read the attempt count, slept, *then* incremented — so N parallel requests from one IP read the same stale count and all slept the same short time, collapsing the escalation. The attempt is now counted **first** with an atomic `INSERT … ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` (the MyISAM table lock serialises concurrent requests), and the sleep is based on the post-increment count (`attempts-1`, so a clean first login stays instant). Verified live: 5 parallel wrong-password logins reach counter=5 and take ~4.2s (escalating) instead of collapsing to ~0.2s; sequential attempts escalate 0→1→2s; the counter still resets on success.
  - **Unguarded `unserialize()` in the journal list path.** `mod_journal` line 169 (the list-all loop) used a bare `unserialize()` while the single-entry path was already guarded in 0.8.1; both now pass `['allowed_classes' => ['lunaException']]`. Latent (only `lunaLog` writes the column) but now consistent.

## [0.8.4-alpha] - 2026-06-20
- **Security — `use_strict_mode` is now actually enforced (review MEDIUM).** The session save-handler was registered via the legacy 6-callback `session_set_save_handler()` form, which cannot expose `validateId()` — so `session.use_strict_mode=1` was inert and `sessionRead()` would `INSERT` (adopt) any client-supplied session id. `lunaSession` now implements `SessionHandlerInterface` + `SessionUpdateTimestampHandlerInterface` and is registered as the object handler; the new `validateId()` accepts only a session id that already exists server-side, so PHP discards a forged id and mints a fresh server-side one. Verified live: a forged cookie `PHPSESSID=abcdef…` is rejected and reissued (no DB row created for it), while anon sessions persist across requests, login still regenerates the id, and logout still destroys the row.

## [0.8.3-alpha] - 2026-06-20
- **Security — logout is now a POST form, not a token-in-URL GET (review MEDIUM).** The nav rendered logout as `GET /logout?csrf_token=<token>`, leaking the per-session CSRF token into browser history and the server access log (and, on some setups, the Referer). The nav now renders a POST `<form>` with the token in a hidden field, and `logout()` requires `POST` + a matching `$_POST` token. Verified live: a forged `GET /logout?csrf_token=<valid>` no longer logs the user out (wrong method), a tokenless cross-site POST is rejected, and the legitimate POST form logs out cleanly; no `?csrf_token=` appears in any rendered URL.

## [0.8.2-alpha] - 2026-06-20
- **Security — login throttle is now per-IP, closing an account-enumeration channel (review HIGH).** The previous back-off slept only for *existing* accounts with prior failures, so an attacker could tell a real account (induces a delay) from an unknown one (no delay). The throttle is now keyed on the client IP in a new `luna_login_throttle` table: every failed login — unknown account, deactivated, or wrong password — counts against the IP and incurs the same escalating sleep (capped 5s, 15-minute window); a successful login clears the IP's counter. Verified live: a 4th failed login on an existing account (~3s) and a 5th on an unknown account (~4s) both sleep (escalation only, existence no longer observable); a correct password resets the counter to zero.

## [0.8.1-alpha] - 2026-06-20
- **Security — review follow-ups (timing, deserialization, sanitizer, authz, purge).** From the adversarial re-review: (1) the legacy-MD5 login branch now also runs a throwaway bcrypt `password_verify` so legacy accounts aren't ~3x faster than the unknown-user path (closes a timing-enumeration channel); (2) `lunaTools::user_can_act_on_text()` now fails **closed** — a text linked to a page with no resolvable level is denied (was fail-open), via a `total == accessible` page-count comparison; (3) HTML_Safe now protocol-filters `formaction`/`poster`/`ping`/`srcset`/`xlink:href` (a `javascript:` formaction/poster survived before); (4) the journal log-message `unserialize()` is guarded with `['allowed_classes' => ['lunaException']]`; (5) the request-driven `?purge` cache flush is removed (it ran pre-session so could never carry a CSRF token, and every mutating mod already purges internally). Verified live.

## [0.8.0-alpha] - 2026-06-20
- **Security — post-review release-blockers (two criticals + audit-log CSRF).** An adversarial re-review found three issues the first pass missed:
  - **Critical: a second blind/stacked SQLi** in `load_texts()` (the twin of the `load_users` fix) — `start`/`limit` reached the `LIMIT` clause raw and were exploitable by any logged-in editor (`limit=20;SELECT SLEEP(5)`). Now `intval`-clamped like `load_users` ([luna.model.class.php](luna/luna.classes/luna.model.class.php)).
  - **Critical: `.htaccess` deny rules were case-sensitive** while the filesystem is case-insensitive, so `/.GIT/HEAD`, `/DOCKERFILE`, `/DOCKER-COMPOSE.YML`, `/DOCS/…` served the full repo + creds. Added `[NC]` (case-insensitive) to every deny rule — uppercase variants now 403.
  - **High: `purgelogs` could wipe the entire audit log via a tokenless cross-site POST** (`mod_journal::load()` runs outside the central CSRF gate). It now requires POST + a valid CSRF token, and the journal page renders a token-bearing purge form. Verified: forged POST leaves the log intact; a tokened request purges.

## [0.7.9-alpha] - 2026-06-20
- **Security — logout is no longer a GET CSRF.** `logout()` now requires a valid CSRF token (read from GET or POST via `request()`), and the nav logout link carries the per-session token in its href. A forged `GET /logout` (e.g. `<img src=/logout>`) without the token no longer destroys the victim's session; the real nav logout still works. Verified live: forged GET leaves the user logged in (200), the tokened nav link logs out (404). Closes the logout residual from 0.7.4.

## [0.7.8-alpha] - 2026-06-20
- **Security — completed the edit_texts IDOR fix: content modify/delete is now gated on the text's pages.** Added `lunaTools::user_can_act_on_text()` (one query resolving the level of every page a text is linked to; the user must hold **all** of them, fail-closed) and call it at the top of `submit_modify` and `submit_delete`. A logged-in editor can no longer modify or delete a text that lives on a page above their level. Verified live with a real `group_edition` editor: **denied** on a text bound to an admin-level page (content left intact, delete refused), **allowed** on a public text (no over-restriction); admin unaffected. This closes the residual flagged in 0.7.6.

## [0.7.7-alpha] - 2026-06-20
- **Docs: recorded the 0.6.9–0.7.6 security hardening pass in [docs/security.md](docs/security.md)** — a status table of the nine areas closed (SQLi, disclosure, headers, session/cookie, passwords, session fixation, CSRF, stored XSS, IDOR) and the remaining partial items (content-level authz, logout GET, UA-bound guard).

## [0.7.6-alpha] - 2026-06-20
- **Security — per-page authorization in edit_texts (IDOR hardening).** Two fixes to `mod_edit_texts`: (1) `submit_modify` validated `add_text_pages` (empty on a modify) while actually linking `modify_text_pages`, so an editor could link a text to **any** page id with no check — it now validates the array it links. (2) Added `lunaTools::user_can_access_page()` (resolves the page's level via `get_level_node` and checks `user_can_access_level`, fail-closed) and applies it to every page a text is linked to in both `submit_add` and `submit_modify` — content can no longer be attached to a page above the user's level. Verified live: admin linking still works; a non-existent/forbidden page id is rejected. Residual (flagged): modify/delete of the *content* of a text already living on a higher-level page is not yet gated on the text's existing pages — a follow-up needing a non-admin editor account to test.

## [0.7.5-alpha] - 2026-06-20
- **Security — closed a stored-XSS bypass + hardened cache deserialization.** Stored content is sanitized through HTML_Safe on save (`sanitize_inputs()` runs `sanitize()` over all of `$_POST`), but the 2009-era blocklist let an SVG SMIL `<animate>` payload through. Added `svg`, `math`, `animate`, `animatetransform`, `animatemotion`, `set`, `foreignobject` to HTML_Safe's `deleteTagsContent` (tag **and** content removed) and the SMIL driver attributes (`attributename`, `from`, `to`, `values`, `begin`, `dur`, `by`) to its dangerous-attribute list. Verified live: an `<svg><animate …>` / `<svg onload>` / `<script>` / `onerror` / `javascript:` payload is fully stripped on save while `<p>`/`<b>`/`<img>` survive. Also passed `['allowed_classes' => false]` to the four server-side cache `unserialize()` sinks (defense-in-depth against PHP object injection).

## [0.7.4-alpha] - 2026-06-20
- **Security — CSRF protection (synchronizer token) + POST-only state changes.** Closes a *confirmed full-takeover* hole: a forged cross-site POST could mint a new administrator account. Every session now carries a 256-bit CSRF token (`luna_sessions.csrf_token`, minted on first read in `sessionRead`, rotated on login), exposed to the templates via `luna::$data['csrf_token']` and emitted as a hidden field in every state-changing form by a shared `csrf-input` XSL template (injected into all 16 admin / login / edit / search forms — as the last form child, after the `xsl:attribute` action). The bootstrap dispatch now rejects any `submit`/`batch_submit` request that isn't a `POST` carrying a token matching the session (`hash_equals`), logs the failure, and skips every `submit_*` handler. `?purge` cache-flush is now POST-only (kills the zero-click `<img>` drive-by). Verified live: the forged admin-creation is blocked ("Security check failed", no row created) while login and every legitimate admin action work with their token. (Logout remains a low-severity GET — flagged for follow-up.)

## [0.7.3-alpha] - 2026-06-20
- **Security — session-ID regeneration on login (session-fixation defence).** `login()` now rotates the session id at the privilege boundary: `session_regenerate_id(false)` (the DB-keyed handler only `UPDATE`s, so the old row is re-keyed to the new id by hand — `session_id` is the PK), then the logged-in `UPDATE`s target the new id. Combined with 0.7.1's `use_strict_mode`, a pre-seeded or pre-auth session id can no longer survive authentication. Verified live: the SID changes at login, the new session stays authenticated, and the old pre-login SID is no longer a logged-in session.

## [0.7.2-alpha] - 2026-06-20
- **Security — passwords migrated from unsalted MD5 to bcrypt, with transparent upgrade-on-login.** Login verifies via `lunaTools::verify_password()`: it accepts a legacy 32-hex MD5 hash (constant-time `hash_equals`) or a modern hash (`password_verify`), and on a successful login with a legacy/outdated hash it silently rehashes the stored password to bcrypt (`PASSWORD_DEFAULT`) — zero downtime, no forced reset. New/changed passwords (admin create + modify) are hashed with bcrypt; `luna_users.password` was widened to `VARCHAR(255)` (live + seed). Login failures now return one generic message ("Invalid email or password.") instead of distinct unknown-user / deactivated / wrong-password branches (the specific reason stays only in the server log), and the unknown/inactive paths run a dummy `password_verify` to flatten timing — closing the account-enumeration channel. Verified live: an MD5 admin logs in and is upgraded to `$2y$` in place, the next login uses the bcrypt path, wrong-password and unknown-user return identical messages.

## [0.7.1-alpha] - 2026-06-20
- **Security — session + cookie hardening.** The session cookie and every `set_cookie()` cookie (session, `lang`, sort prefs) now carry **HttpOnly + SameSite=Lax** — and `Secure` automatically under HTTPS — via the PHP 7.3+ array signatures. Sessions are now **cookie-only**: `session.use_trans_sid=0`, `use_only_cookies=1`, `use_strict_mode=1`, so a SID is never propagated through the URL (closing the `trans_sid` leak / fixation enabler) and an attacker-supplied session id is rejected instead of adopted. Removed the now-dead PHPSESSID-in-URL append in `go()`. Verified live: `Set-Cookie` shows `HttpOnly; SameSite=Lax`, a forged SID is not adopted, and valid logged-in sessions persist.

## [0.7.0-alpha] - 2026-06-20
- **Security — HTTP security headers + closed source/secret disclosure.** Added `lunaTools::send_security_headers()` (called early in the bootstrap): a Content-Security-Policy (`default-src 'self'`, `object-src`/`frame-ancestors 'none'`, `base-uri`/`form-action 'self'`), `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `Referrer-Policy`, `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy`, and `header_remove('X-Powered-By')`. (CSP keeps `'unsafe-inline'` for scripts/styles for now because the admin UI still has inline `onclick`/`onchange` handlers — to be tightened with the XSS batch.) Hardened the root `.htaccess` to return 403 for direct access to `/.git`, `*.ini`/`*.sql`/`*.dist`/`*.example`/`*.log`, `docker-compose.yml`/`Dockerfile`/`Makefile`, and `docs/`/`scss/` — the `.git` repo, `db.ini`, demo creds, and the vuln-map doc were all served at web root (confirmed 200 → now 403). Defaulted the committed `luna.ini` to `DEBUG=0` (no `display_errors` leak) and removed the dead `lunaTools::debug()` die-dump.

## [0.6.9-alpha] - 2026-06-20
- **Security — critical blind SQL injection in the admin users list (FIXED).** `load_users()` ([luna.model.class.php](luna/luna.classes/luna.model.class.php)) interpolated the request-supplied `order_by` straight into the `ORDER BY` SQL identifier through the `switch` default branch — `order_by=last_time,(SELECT(SLEEP(3)))` was confirmed exploitable. Replaced the switch with a whitelist map (key → fixed column) that also normalizes the reflected/persisted value to a safe key; `start`/`limit` are now `intval()`-cast before the `LIMIT` clause; the `levels` `IN()` list is `intval`-mapped with an empty-guard (defense-in-depth). Verified live: the `SLEEP(3)` payload runs in ~1s (== baseline), the list still renders/sorts, a bad `limit` returns 200, and raw `order_by` is no longer reflected. First of a multi-batch hardening pass (audit confirmed CSRF/IDOR/stored-XSS/MD5/session issues — batches to follow).

## [0.6.8-alpha] - 2026-06-20
- **Removed jQuery and all JS animations.** The front-end no longer loads jQuery (3.7.1 from CDN). `js/luna.js` is now ~25 lines of dependency-free vanilla JS with no animation: `confirmSubmit()` (delete confirmations), zebra striping + row hover (`.even`/`.odd`/`.hover` classes), and the collapsible `.box-handle` toggle (the bottom-bar hamburger sitemap), which now flips classes and the adjacent `.box-content` display **instantly** instead of `show/hide('slow')`. Also dropped the dead inline-config `<script>` (`basehref`/`pagenid`/`ckeditorconfig` — CKEditor/TinyMCE were already removed) and the long-broken jQuery TreeView code (its `li[ul]` selector matched nothing, so the sitemap tree was already a static list). Show/hide is now instant — add a CSS transition on `.box-content` if you want movement. Verified in a real JS engine (jsdom): no errors, `jQuery`/`$` undefined, hamburger toggle + zebra + `confirmSubmit` all work on the public and admin pages.

## [0.6.7-alpha] - 2026-06-20
- **English locale is now `en-US` everywhere (was the bogus `en-EN`).** `format_language()` derived a region by upper-casing the language code (`en`→`EN`) — fine for `fr`→`FR`, wrong for English. Added a canonical-region map (`en`→`US`); because the region is always re-derived (texts store only a 2-char lang), this single point flows `en-US` through `site_langs`, the nav language switcher, the default page language, the page `<html lang>`, and every text's `xml:lang`. The English switcher button is now `?lang=en-US` and is **selected on the default page load**. Also hardened `set_language()`: the `session_lang` fallback now validates against `site_langs` (the one branch that didn't), so a stale `en-EN` cookie/session falls back cleanly to the default. No config or schema change. Verified live and adversarially (default / en-US / fr-FR / stale en-EN, switcher selection, text `xml:lang`, gettext, JSON-LD + RDF graph, edit_texts, admin): all `en-US`, zero `en-EN`, French untouched.

## [0.6.6-alpha] - 2026-06-19
- **Page texts: skip empty titles, render only the current language.** The `page` template (in [luna.default.html.xsl](luna/luna.xsl/luna.html.xsl/luna.default.html.xsl) and the homepage [luna.root.html.xsl](luna/luna.xsl/luna.html.xsl/luna.root.html.xsl)) rendered every attached `luna:text` regardless of language and printed the model's no-title sentinel `"0"` as an `<h2>`. Now: (1) the `<h2>` is wrapped in `<xsl:if>` that skips a blank or `"0"` title (genuine titles kept; the body still renders); (2) the `for-each` filters texts by the current page language with a **primary-subtag** match (`substring-before(@xml:lang,'-') = substring-before($lang,'-')`) — so `/about` in English shows only the English text, in French only the French. Primary-subtag (not full-tag) match is deliberate: it stays robust to the default page language resolving to `en-US` while texts are tagged `en-EN` (a separate latent bug at `luna.php:106`), so the default page never blanks. HTML-only change — the RDF/XML graph and in-head JSON-LD still carry every language. Applied byte-identically to both page templates; verified live and adversarially reviewed.

## [0.6.5-alpha] - 2026-06-19
- **Fixed: the edit_texts language field could only be set to the default (`en-EN`).** In the shared `forminput` template's `data`-mode `<option>`, the *translated language name* (`luna:value`, e.g. "Français") was put in `@value` — the value the browser submits — while the language *code* was shown as the label. `mod_edit_texts` validates the submission against `site_langs` (the codes) with `in_array()`, so any non-default choice failed the check and silently fell back to the first language. Swapped them in [common.html.xsl](luna/luna.xsl/luna.html.xsl/luna.common.html.xsl): `@value` is now the code (`luna:lid`, e.g. `fr-FR`), the visible label is the readable name, and the selected-state tests compare the code. Verified on both the add and modify forms (modify correctly pre-selects the text's own language). The `char(2)` `lang` column still stores `fr`; `format_language()` rebuilds `fr-FR` on render — unchanged.

## [0.6.4-alpha] - 2026-06-19
- **Site page labels moved to a separate, git-ignored gettext domain** — so a site's page-label translations no longer pollute the engine's catalog (reverts the `about` entry added to `luna.po` in 0.6.3). The engine `luna` catalog stays purely the CMS's UI vocabulary; per-site labels live in a `local` domain (`<lang>/LC_MESSAGES/local.po` / `local.mo`), git-ignored. New helper `lunaTools::label($lid)` resolves a label by trying `local` → engine `luna` → the raw lid; the model's three `rdfs:label` assignments now route through it, and the `local` domain is bound next to `luna`. Workflow to add a label: edit the git-ignored `local.po`, `msgfmt`, restart — nothing site-specific reaches the repo. See [luna/luna.locale/README.md](luna/luna.locale/README.md).

## [0.6.3-alpha] - 2026-06-19
- **Localised the `/about` page label.** Page labels are produced by `_($lid)` (gettext) → the node's `rdfs:label` ([luna.model.class.php:1970](luna/luna.classes/luna.model.class.php)), so a lid with no catalog entry renders verbatim. Added `msgid "about"` → `"About"` (`en_EN`) / `"À propos"` (`fr_FR`) to the gettext catalogs and recompiled the `.mo`s, so the page name now localises in the header, sitemap and breadcrumb. (`en_US` is unused — not in the language switcher — so left as-is.)

## [0.6.2-alpha] - 2026-06-19
- **Source maps now on every dev build** (`make css` and `make css-watch`), not just the watch loop — the earlier split meant a plain `make css` produced a map-less `css/luna.css`, so dev tools still showed `luna.css` line numbers. `make css-min` remains the clean, minified production build with no map. The `.map` stays gitignored.

## [0.6.1-alpha] - 2026-06-19
- **SCSS source maps in the dev build.** `make css-watch` now compiles with source maps (`--embed-sources`), so browser dev tools point compiled rules back to the `_*.scss` file and line instead of `luna.css`. The map (`css/luna.css.map`) is gitignored; `make css` stays clean (no source map) for the committed `css/luna.css`. Shared Sass flags were factored into a `SASS_FLAGS` variable in the `Makefile`.

## [0.6.0-alpha] - 2026-06-19
- **Adopted a baseline grid for typography** — [baselinegrid.scss](https://github.com/jeromev/baselinegrid.scss) (v3.0.1, MIT © Jérôme Vogel), vendored under `scss/vendor/`:
  - `scss/_bg.scss` configures it (`@forward 'baselinegrid'`); `_base.scss` calls `@include bg.begin()`, sets `html { @include bg.root(); font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; }` (a responsive base font + the `--base-unit` rhythm), reconciles form-control fonts (`font: inherit`), and aligns body text via `p { @include bg.set(); }`.
  - The `Makefile` build passes `--load-path=scss/vendor --quiet-deps`, so the vendored lib stays pristine while its compile-time deprecation notices are silenced (luna's own warnings still show).
  - Verified across content and admin (forms, tables, the bottom navbar) at the responsive scale: body text sits on a consistent baseline; the chrome is intact; clean compile; zero runtime warnings/fatals.
  - Foundation only — content headings (via `bg.scale('font-size', …)`, scoped because `h1`/`h2` are chrome here) and tuning the type `$scale` are the obvious next steps.

## [0.5.9-alpha] - 2026-06-19
- **Fixed: saving a text (or any logged admin action) showed a `DEBUGGING` dump instead of the page.** `lunaLog::log()` called `lunaTools::debug()` — which prints globals / included-files / DB-queries and `die()`s — on *every* log call whenever `DEBUG` is on and the user is an admin. Saving a text logs an INFO message ("…has been modified."), so the response terminated with the debug screen instead of returning to the editor. Removed that auto-dump; `log()` now just writes the row to `luna_logs`. Logs are inspected on the admin **journal** page, uncaught errors keep their own error page, and an explicit `lunaTools::debug()` call is still there for ad-hoc dev use. Saving now returns to the normal HTML editor with its success message, and the action is still logged.

## [0.5.8-alpha] - 2026-06-19
- **Fixed: edited text lost its markup on render.** Text saved through the `edit_texts` module came back as plain text (`<p>`, `<strong>`, links… stripped) when displayed.
  - **Root cause:** the triplestore (the default read path) stored text content only as `schema:articleBody`, which the write-through deliberately runs through `strip_tags()` (correct — `articleBody` is plain text for schema.org). The read path (`load_texts_sparql`) then rebuilt the rendered `content_html` *from* that stripped `articleBody`. Un-edited texts looked fine because the R2RML mapping materialised `articleBody` un-stripped — markup was lost only once a text was **edited** (when the PHP write-through overwrote it with the stripped version), exactly matching the report.
  - **Fix:** the write-through ([rdf_sync_node](luna/luna.classes/luna.model.class.php)) now also stores the full markup as **`luna:content`** (alongside the plain `schema:articleBody`), and the read path reads `luna:content` for the rendered content (falling back to `articleBody` for texts not yet re-synced). The R2RML mapping ([semantic/ontop/mapping.ttl](semantic/ontop/mapping.ttl)) maps `content_html` → `luna:content` too, so the materialise / Ontop paths stay consistent.
  - Verified on the live stack: edited text renders its full markup through **both** the graph and SQL read paths; rich content (quotes, `&`, newlines, `<a href>`) round-trips intact; the JSON-LD `schema:articleBody` stays correctly plain-text; zero warnings/fatals.

## [0.5.7-alpha] - 2026-06-19
- **Un-bundled jQuery — load it from a CDN.** Removed the vendored `js/jquery/jquery.js` (jQuery 1.4.1, 2010) and now load **jQuery 3.7.1 from cdnjs** with an SRI `integrity` hash + `crossorigin` / `referrerpolicy` ([luna.header.html.xsl](luna/luna.xsl/luna.html.xsl/luna.header.html.xsl)).
  - **Updated `js/luna.js` for jQuery 3.x:** the two-callback `.toggle(fn, fn)` (removed in jQuery 1.9) is gone — the `.box-handle` collapse that drives the bottom-bar hamburger is now a single class-driven click handler, and the tree-view caret uses a delegated click. The rest (zebra striping, row hover) was already 3.x-compatible.
  - Verified in a real browser (headless Chrome): `jQuery.fn.jquery` reports `3.7.1`, the SRI passes, the hamburger toggles the sitemap (`display: none → block`), and there are no console errors beyond the pre-existing `favicon.ico` 404.
  - Updated [THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md](THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md) (jQuery is no longer bundled). **Note:** the page now needs internet access to fetch jQuery from the CDN.

## [0.5.6-alpha] - 2026-06-19
- **New fixed bottom toolbar.** All site tools now live in one bar pinned to the bottom of every page:
  - a **hamburger** (`☰ Site map`) on the left that pops the sitemap tree up as a panel above the bar — it reuses the existing `box-handle` jQuery toggle, and the sitemap now defaults to **collapsed**;
  - the **language** switches and **output-format** switches (html / xml / json / n3 / jsonld) on the right.
  - The left nav column is gone, so page content is now **full-width**; the top header (logo + page title) stays. `div#Page` is a single-column grid with bottom padding so content clears the fixed bar.
  - XSL: the sitemap `box-handle` now defaults to `collapsed` ([luna.common.html.xsl](luna/luna.xsl/luna.html.xsl/luna.common.html.xsl)); no JS change — the existing toggle drives the hamburger.
  - Verified with headless-Chrome screenshots (home, login, authenticated admin) and a live click-test (the tree's `display` flips `none` → `block` on click); zero warnings/fatals.

## [0.5.5-alpha] - 2026-06-19
- **Replaced every CSS float with Grid / Flexbox** (`grep float css/luna.css` → 0):
  - **Page macro-layout → CSS Grid.** `body div#Page` now uses `grid-template-areas` ("top" spanning the full width, then `nav` + `content`), placing the header, left nav and right content by area regardless of DOM order — replacing the old `div#Content { float: right }` + full-width-`div#Nav` float trick.
  - **Flexbox** for the `div#Top` header (its two boxes now sit side-by-side as intended, instead of wrapping from the old width+margin overflow), the admin form columns (`div.fields`), the `div#Options` language/output switcher, and `div#Nav`.
  - Removed the float **clearfix** (`_clearfix.scss` is now empty) and the obsolete float-clearing `clear: both` — grid/flex contain their own children.
  - Verified with before/after headless-Chrome screenshots (home, login, authenticated admin incl. an expanded multi-column form): the two-column layout, forms, nav tree, zebra tables and language switcher all render correctly with zero warnings/fatals. The only intentional visual change is the header becoming a proper side-by-side row.

## [0.5.4-alpha] - 2026-06-19
- **Refactored the SCSS partials into nested rules.** The flat descendant selectors (which repeated their full ancestor chain on every line) are now idiomatic nested SCSS — the `form` → `fieldset` → fields block, the whole `table.zebra` block (`_base.scss`), the deep `body div#Page …` layout tree (`_page.scss`), and the `ul.tv …` tree (`_treeview.scss`); pseudo-classes / compound selectors use `&` (`&:hover`, `&.even`, `&.submit`). The nesting is order-preserving, so the **compiled `css/luna.css` is byte-identical** (normalised) to before — verified against a pre-refactor snapshot of the exact same flat source. Carries forward the in-progress responsive width tweaks (rem → `%`) already in the working tree.

## [0.5.3-alpha] - 2026-06-19
- **Added an SCSS build apparatus for the stylesheet.** `css/luna.css` is now a *generated* file compiled from a new `scss/` source tree with [Dart Sass](https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass):
  - `scss/luna.scss` is the entry point; the previous single stylesheet is split into partials along its existing sections — `_tokens.scss` (the `:root` palette), `_base.scss`, `_classes.scss`, `_page.scss`, `_clearfix.scss`, `_tinymce.scss`, `_treeview.scss` — wired with `@use`.
  - A root `Makefile` drives it: `make css` (one-off), `make css-watch` (live rebuild on save), `make css-min` (minified). `sass` must be on `PATH`.
  - `.gitignore` now ignores Sass artifacts (`.sass-cache/`, `*.css.map`); `scss/README.md` documents the workflow.
  - The regenerated `css/luna.css` is CSS-equivalent to the previous hand-written file — verified by normalised comparison; the only differences are whitespace (the generated file is 2-space indented) and Sass number-normalisation (e.g. `.90` → `0.9`). The palette stays as CSS custom properties (runtime-themeable), not Sass variables.
  - **Workflow going forward:** edit the partials under `scss/`, run `make css`, and commit both the partial(s) and the regenerated `css/luna.css`. Do not hand-edit `css/luna.css`.

## [0.5.2-alpha] - 2026-06-19
- **Vendor-code audit + minimal cleanup.** A multi-agent audit inventoried every piece of third-party code still in the tree (each tagged used/dead and cross-checked against the notices). Acted on the safe findings:
  - **Corrected [THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md](THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md)**, which the recent migrations had made inaccurate: dropped the **PEAR MDB2** row (removed in 0.5.0-alpha), replaced the wrong **XML_Util** row with the **XML_HTMLSax3** that is actually bundled (HTML_Safe's SAX parser), refreshed the stale "targets PHP 5.3–5.6" line and a few license/version details (ARC2 → semsol/arc2 3.1.0 GPL-2/W3C; jQuery 1.4.1 dual MIT/GPL), and added an **"Inlined third-party functions"** section documenting the small credited snippets copied into app code (phpBB `encode_ip`/`decode_ip`, WordPress `remove_accents`, Drupal `conf_path`/`conf_init`, the lost-in-code `array_to_object`).
  - **Removed dead code:** `lunaTools::parse_bbcode()` — a BBCode→HTML routine verified completely unreferenced across the tree.
  - **Removed orphaned assets:** the six duplicate `images/treeView/*.gif` icons (the `.png` variants + `tviload.gif` are the ones actually referenced by `css/luna.css`) and the unreferenced `images/body.png`.
  - No behavioural change: every public page still renders with zero warnings/fatals; the audit confirmed CKEditor is fully gone and that the kept libraries (ARC2 serializers, HTML_Safe + XML_HTMLSax3, Cache_Lite, PEAR Log constants, jQuery) are all genuinely used.

## [0.5.1-alpha] - 2026-06-19
- **Modernised `css/luna.css` (syntax cleanup, no intended visual change).** The 15-year-old admin/theme stylesheet brought up to date while keeping a pixel-identical result:
  - **Lowercased element selectors** (`HTML`/`BODY`/`TABLE`/… → `html`/`body`/`table`/…). IDs and classes keep their original casing because the XSL markup is case-sensitive (`#Page`, `#Content`, `.zebra`, …).
  - **Dropped all `-moz-`/`-webkit-` prefixes** for standard `border-radius` / `box-shadow` / `border-*-radius`. This also *restores* rounded corners that modern browsers no longer render, since the obsolete `-moz-border-radius` family was the only declaration in several rules.
  - **Replaced the `images/background/{black,white}NN.png` overlay tiles with `rgba()` fills.** Verified each PNG is a uniform 2×2 solid black/white image whose alpha byte equals its name (e.g. `black10.png` → α 26 ≈ 10% → `rgba(0,0,0,.10)`; `white60.png` → α 153 ≈ 60% → `rgba(255,255,255,.60)`), so the swap is pixel-exact. Real image assets (treeView icons, menu collapse/expand arrows) stay as `url()`.
  - **Added a `:root` custom-property palette** for the recurring colours (`--ink`, `--chrome`, `--link`, `--accent`, `--ok`, `--warn`, …) and the base `--font`.
  - **Removed dead cruft** (visual no-ops on modern browsers): IE6 underscore hacks in the tree view (`_background`/`_filter`/`_left`), the old "easyclearing" float hack (now minimal `content:""; clear:both`), a commented-out `white70` background, an `overflow:auto;;` double semicolon, and the `-webkit-border-top-right-radius: 4px` typo on `div.fields` (normalised to the intended 5px).
  - Flattened the original cascading indentation to a consistent modern style.
- **PHP 8 review pass — fixed latent issues a multi-agent review surfaced** (follow-up to the 0.5.0 upgrade), each grounded in the running 8.3 stack:
  - **Fatal:** `mod_journal` calls `Log::priorityToString()` / `stringToPriority()` statically, but the kept `Log.php` declared them non-static — a hard PHP-8 error the moment an admin opens the journal with log rows. Both are now `static`.
  - **Latent fatal:** `lunaTools::array_to_object()` assigned a property on `false` (`$data = false; $data->{$k} = …`) — now seeds `new stdClass()`.
  - **Warnings (admin pages — now zero):** the user-list sort switched on an undefined `$order_by` (→ switch on the resolved `$cookie['order_by']`); `$_GET['path']`, `$user['session_ip']` and `$row->page_nid` were read without guards (→ `isset` / `??`).
  - **Deprecations:** `strftime()` (removed in PHP 9) → `date()` in `format_date()`; `lunaException`'s dynamic `$session` / `$server` properties are now declared (PHP 8.2).
  - **Data-loss bug:** saving a text's content without re-submitting its page set unlinked it from its page (orphaning it → "Unknown text #N" on the next edit). `mod_edit_texts` now only unlinks when a page set is actually submitted. Separately, a `lunaException` logged with no code was recorded as `EMERG`; it now defaults to `ERR`.
  - **Schema:** `luna_logs.logtime` had no default, so a fresh MySQL-8 install wrote `0000-00-00`; added `DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` to the seed.
  - Verified authenticated on the live 8.3 stack: every public + admin page renders with **zero warnings/fatals**; the journal renders its priority labels; a content-only text edit keeps its page link and mirrors through to Oxigraph.
- **Docs: PHP-version accuracy sweep.** Updated the README and `docs/` (installation, overview, security, architecture, database-schema, configuration, why-rdf, docs/README) to state **PHP 8.3 / MySQL 8.0 + PDO** instead of the pre-upgrade "PHP 5.3–5.6 only / PEAR MDB2 / `mysql_*`" facts that the 0.5.0 migration made false.

## [0.5.0-alpha] - 2026-06-19
- **Runtime upgrade: PHP 5.6 → PHP 8.3, MySQL 5.7 → MySQL 8.0.** The app now runs on a current stack. Verified end-to-end on Docker: HTML, RDF/XML (`?output=xml`) and JSON-LD output are **byte-identical** to the PHP-5.6 baseline; the XSS sanitiser output is byte-identical; login, the admin CRUD path, logging, and the RDF read/write loop all work; every page renders with **zero PHP warnings**; all 100 PHP files lint clean on 8.3.
  - **Database: dropped PEAR MDB2 + `ext/mysql` (removed in PHP 7) for PDO (`pdo_mysql`).** `luna.db.class.php` rewritten to keep the exact `lunaDB::query/quote/get/nextID/optimise` surface plus a small `lunaResult` wrapper (`->fetchRow()` via `PDO::FETCH_OBJ`, `->free()`). `quote()` reproduces MDB2's auto-typed quoting exactly (verified against the live MDB2 stack): `null`/`''`→`NULL`, `bool`→`0`/`1`, `int`→bare, float/string→escaped. `nextID()` reproduces MDB2's `luna_nodes_seq` sequence emulation (and the seq is re-seated to `MAX(nid)+1`).
  - **RDF: replaced the 2011 vendored ARC2 with the maintained `semsol/arc2` 3.1.0** (vendored, same global `ARC2::` API, no Composer). Patched its N-Triples serializer for two PHP-8 strictnesses (array term without `type`; a UTF-8 `escape()` step that mangled multibyte to `?`) so output matches/`improves on` the old serializer.
  - **Logging: replaced the MDB2-bound PEAR Log handler with a direct PDO `INSERT`** in `lunaLog::log()`; kept `Log.php` for the `PEAR_LOG_*` constants and `Log::priorityToString()`.
  - **Removed now-dead vendored code:** the entire MDB2 tree, the PEAR Log driver dir, the PEAR installer tree, and `XML/Util.php`.
  - **Patched the kept vendored libs for PHP 8** (behaviour-preserving): the sanitiser chain (`HTML/Safe`, `XML/HTMLSax3`, `Decorators`) and `Cache/Lite` — PHP-4 constructors → `__construct` (+ `parent::__construct()` wiring), `=& new` → `= new`, curly `$x{}` offsets → `$x[]`, `/e` `preg_replace` → `preg_replace_callback`. A `magic_quotes_runtime` no-op polyfill lives in `luna.php`.
  - **App-code PHP-8 fixes:** `=& new` sweep (8 sites), `ereg_replace` → `preg_replace`, `utf8_encode` → `mb_convert_encoding`; static-call fixes (the `lunaDB`/`lunaLog` methods are now `static`; `get_user_data()` is called on the session instance); the DB session handler now returns the correct types (`read()`→string, `write()`→bool, the PHP-8 "failed to read session data" + TypeError fixes); and `isset`/`??`/`empty()` guards for the array-key/variable accesses PHP 8 reclassified from notice to warning.
  - **Docker:** `Dockerfile` → `php:8.3-apache` (`pdo_mysql`, `xsl`, `gettext`, `mbstring`; dropped the Debian-archive apt pin and `ext/mysql`); `docker-compose.yml` → `mysql:8.0` (utf8mb4, native arm64 — dropped the `platform: linux/amd64` emulation line). Ports stay loopback-bound.

## [0.4.1-alpha] - 2026-06-19
- Public-readiness, part 2 — make it a real teaching unit + open-source hygiene (docs/config only).
  - **Hands-on lab:** [docs/try-it.md](docs/try-it.md) — a ~10-minute guided tour (data views → SPARQL → edit-and-read-back → swap the engine → federation), and [examples/queries.sparql](examples/queries.sparql) — copy-paste queries (census, graph traversal, `isPartOf+`, `ASK`, `CONSTRUCT`, `DESCRIBE`, cross-store `SERVICE` federation), all verified against the running stack.
  - **OSS hygiene:** [THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md](THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md) (bundled libs + licenses), [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md), [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and `.github/` (issue + PR templates; a CI workflow that runs `php -l` on the project code, validates `docker compose config`, and asserts every published port stays bound to `127.0.0.1`).
  - **Checklist:** [docs/going-public.md](docs/going-public.md) records the five-dimension readiness audit, what's done, and the owner-only steps that remain (rotate the old DB credential; flip the repo to public; set description/topics).
  - Wired the lab + checklist into the docs index and both READMEs.

## [0.4.0-alpha] - 2026-06-19
- Public-readiness, part 1 — safety + trim (toward making the repo a public, minimal, safe semantic-web testing unit; the remaining git history was audited and confirmed clean — no secret was ever committed).
  - **Safety (blocker):** `docker-compose.yml` now binds **every** host port to `127.0.0.1` (loopback) — app `8080`, MySQL `3307`, Ontop `8081`, Oxigraph `7879`. Previously they published to `0.0.0.0`, exposing an **unauthenticated Oxigraph `/update`** (open graph-write) and the MySQL port to the whole network on a bare `docker-compose up`.
  - **Safety:** added a loud "study/experiment artifact — run on localhost only" banner at the top of the README (before the quick start), a demo-credentials note next to the login line, and a concrete loopback-binding mitigation in `docs/security.md`.
  - **Trim (~40% smaller: 15 MB → 8.6 MB):** removed **CKEditor** (`js/ckeditor`, ~6 MB) — the admin text editor is now a plain `<textarea>` (you see the exact HTML going into the graph); neutralised its wiring in `luna.header.html.xsl` and `js/luna.js`. Removed the **`lunarsystem.org` production domain** (theme + the real-looking on-disk `db.ini`); the demo uses `luna.default`.
  - Docs: fixed every reference to the removed CKEditor / production domain across README, configuration, templating, modules, security, roadmap; resolved the "real DB credentials in the working tree" security finding (the file is gone).
  - Verified on Docker: site renders, content still served from the triplestore, no errors.

## [0.3.6-alpha] - 2026-06-19
- Docs: added **[docs/why-rdf.md](docs/why-rdf.md)** — a plain-English "so what?" doc explaining what the RDF-native app can do that a vanilla PHP/MySQL app can't (ad-hoc SPARQL across all content types, graph traversal, the app's own routing/ACL answered by SPARQL; schema.org JSON-LD + standards-based interop; storage as a swappable component), each capability tagged **live** / **one step away** / **roadmap** and grounded in queries run against the live stack. Wired into the docs index and READMEs. The doc's claims were adversarially fact-checked against the running Oxigraph/Ontop stack (zero inaccuracies found). No code change.

## [0.3.5-alpha] - 2026-06-19
- Docs: full accuracy audit of every doc/readme against the current RDF-native code (multi-agent pass, each finding adversarially verified). No code change.
  - Fixed ~20 stale `luna.php`/`*.class.php` line-number anchors across `architecture.md`, `templating.md`, `configuration.md`, `modules.md`, and `security.md` that had drifted after the 0.3.3/0.3.4 code (the model gained ~280 lines, `luna.php` ~20). Constructor 199, `set_requested_path` 316, `set_site_path` 327, `load_mods` 394, `transform` 518, `load_ini` 641, the OPTIMIZE/dispatch/JSON-LD-head anchors, etc.
  - `docs/README.md`: dropped "client-side rendering" from the roadmap summary (P5 was dropped).
  - `docs/modules.md` + `docs/rdf-model.md`: the CRUD methods now mirror writes into the triplestore via `rdf_sync_node()`; scoped the "RDF is not a storage engine" claim to the archival model.
  - `docs/templating.md`: corrected `forminput` attribution (it lives in `luna.common.html.xsl`, not `_admin`); added `jsonld` to the output-format list in `architecture.md`.
  - `docs/database-schema.md`: the `langs` string is split by `lunaTools::load_config()`, not `set_language()`.
  - `docs/linked-data.md`: clarified that level/group/mod nodes are projected untyped (no `rdf:type`), and that edges are `/id/{lid}` URIs while scalars carry `xsd:integer`.
  - `docs/security.md`: fixed remediation anchors and added a **"Triplestore / SPARQL surface"** section (unauthenticated Oxigraph endpoints must stay internal; hand-rolled SPARQL string assembly; best-effort write-through).

## [0.3.4-alpha] - 2026-06-19
- Semantic web (P2, first step — URI-identity policy). Resolved roadmap decision #1 as **"forbid slug edits"** and enforced it: `lunaModel::update()` now refuses any change to a node's `lid`, since `<base/id/{lid}>` *is* the resource's identity and the cardinal rule is "freeze the URIs." A rename is create-new + delete-old. This applies to every node type (page slugs, user emails, …), as all share the `/id/{lid}` scheme. Normal edits (same lid) are unaffected; a true rename returns `false` and logs a warning. Verified on Docker. The rest of P2 — retiring the MySQL *content write* itself — remains a larger, deliberate migration (see [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md)).

## [0.3.3-alpha] - 2026-06-19
- Semantic web (Phase C complete — the triplestore is now authoritative for the read/write loop; MySQL stays the system of record). The RDF track is being finished; the client-side-XSLT idea (roadmap P5) has been **dropped**. See [docs/linked-data.md](docs/linked-data.md) and [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md).
  - **P0 — generic write-through.** Replaced the per-mod `rdf_put_article` hook with a generic projection wired into the model's CRUD, so *every* content write mirrors to the graph by construction:
    - `lunaModel::rdf_sync_node($nid)` re-projects a node's whole description (`DELETE { <uri> ?p ?o } INSERT { … }`) to match the R2RML mapping — typing the resource (`page`→`schema:WebPage`, `text`→`schema:Article`, `user`→`foaf:Person`, level/group/mod→`luna:`) and its edges (`schema:isPartOf`/`hasPart`, `luna:level`), with numeric values typed `xsd:integer`. Called from `insert`/`update`/`link`/`unlink` (and by `mod_edit_texts` after a text-body write).
    - `lunaModel::rdf_delete_node($nid)` removes every triple mentioning a resource (subject *and* object), inside `delete()`.
    - `lunaModel::rdf_resync_all()` re-projects every node from MySQL — a pure-PHP bootstrap/repair of the store that replaces the Ontop "materialise" step. Used to close a real drift gap (a page that predated the dual-write) to exact count parity.
  - **P1 — reads default to the graph.** The read path (routing, ACL, texts) is now served from the triplestore by default: `SPARQL_ENDPOINT` defaults to **Oxigraph** (Ontop becomes an opt-in override), gated by `lunaModel::sparql_reads()` (`SPARQL_READS`, default on). Both the routing and text loaders keep an automatic **SQL fallback**; `?sparql=0` forces the SQL path. (`sanitize_inputs()` turns `'0'`→`false`, so the opt-out is read from `$_GET` with a `(bool)` cast, not via `lunaTools::request()`.)
  - Verified end-to-end on Docker: insert→link→delete of a throwaway page produced then fully removed its projection in Oxigraph; an Oxigraph-only sentinel rendered by default and vanished under `?sparql=0`; guest/admin routing + level-based ACL resolve from the graph.
  - Still SQL-only (by design, for now): the mod list (`load_mods`) and the `luna_actions` audit trail. Retiring the MySQL content write (single source of truth) is **P2**, blocked on the rename/URI-identity decision.

## [0.3.2-alpha] - 2026-06-18
- Semantic web (Phase C, in progress — make the triplestore authoritative): content **writes** now flow into the graph via SPARQL `UPDATE`, the write counterpart to the read-through-SPARQL path.
  - `lunaModel::sparql_update()` POSTs a SPARQL `UPDATE` to a new `SPARQL_UPDATE_ENDPOINT` (Oxigraph; best-effort, so a failed mirror never breaks a save), with `sparql_literal()` for safe string escaping.
  - `lunaModel::rdf_put_article()` mirrors a text block as a `schema:Article` (headline/articleBody/inLanguage) for `<base/id/{lid}>`; `mod_edit_texts` calls it on text **create and modify**.
  - Editing page content in the admin UI now **dual-writes** — the existing SQL write to MySQL *plus* a SPARQL `DELETE`/`INSERT` to the graph. Verified end-to-end on Docker: an admin text edit lands in both MySQL and Oxigraph, and the app reads it back from the triplestore. See [docs/linked-data.md](docs/linked-data.md) ("Writing through SPARQL").

## [0.3.1-alpha] - 2026-06-18
- Fixed: **localisation did nothing.** The Docker image installed the `gettext` extension but never generated the OS locales, so `setlocale()` failed and every translation silently fell back to the source string. The image now generates `en_US.UTF-8`, `fr_FR.UTF-8` and an `en_EN.UTF-8` alias (the locales `lunaTools::format_language()` maps to). French (and any other catalog) now translates.
- Fixed: the English message catalogs (`en_US`, `en_EN`) contained two stray **French** translations (`Email`→"Courriel", `Groups`→"Groupes"), so once the catalogs loaded the English UI showed French. Corrected to "Email"/"Groups" and recompiled the `.mo` files. (This was misdiagnosed at first as a gettext per-worker cache leak; it was purely bad catalog data.)
- Fixed: **`?output=xml` downloaded a `download.rdf` file** instead of displaying. It was served as `application/rdf+xml`, which browsers have no inline viewer for. It now uses `application/xml; charset=utf-8`, so the RDF/XML renders inline; the body is unchanged and still valid RDF/XML. (`json`/`n3`/`jsonld` keep their semantic content-types.)

## [0.3.0-alpha] - 2026-06-18
- Turn the archival CMS into a real Semantic Web CMS in phases, on top of the **unchanged** MySQL schema. This is now the `main` line; the original archival CMS is preserved on the **`legacy`** branch (tag **0.2.14-alpha**). See [docs/linked-data.md](docs/linked-data.md).
  - **Phase 0 — Linked Data foundations + JSON-LD.** Froze a URI policy (resource `/id/{slug}` distinct from its document) and a vocabulary mapping from the custom `luna:`/`owl:` terms to schema.org / Dublin Core / SIOC / FOAF / PROV-O — notably replacing the invalid `owl:isChildOf` with `schema:isPartOf`. Added a JSON-LD projection: `lunaModel::to_jsonld()`, an `?output=jsonld` format, and a `<script type="application/ld+json">` block embedded in every HTML `<head>`.
  - **Phase A — virtual SPARQL over MySQL (Ontop + R2RML).** Added `semantic/ontop/` (Dockerfile, `mapping.ttl`, `ontop.properties`) exposing the unchanged MySQL as a virtual SPARQL endpoint (Ontop, host port 8081). Under `?sparql=1` the app's READ path now flows through SPARQL: `lunaModel::load_texts_sparql()` (page content) and `lunaModel::load_nodes_sparql()` (routing + level-based ACL), both via `lunaModel::sparql_select()`. The endpoint is selected by a `SPARQL_ENDPOINT` constant / env var (default `http://ontop:8080/sparql`).
  - **Phase B — materialise to Oxigraph, swap the engine.** Materialised the SAME `mapping.ttl` into a real triplestore (Oxigraph, host port 7879) via `semantic/ontop/dump.nt`, then flipped the app's `SPARQL_ENDPOINT` to point at it — an engine swap with NO application code change (verified by stopping Ontop and confirming `?sparql=1` still serves routing/ACL/content from the triplestore).
  - **Docker:** `docker-compose.yml` now defines four services — `app`, `db` (`mysql:5.7`), `ontop`, `oxigraph`.

## [0.2.14-alpha] - 2026-06-18
- Security: hardened the self-contained issues from the 0.2.12 code-review pass (verified against the Docker stack). See [docs/security.md](docs/security.md).
  - SQL injection in `mod_journal`: `start` is now `intval()`'d before the `LIMIT` clause and `order_by` is whitelisted before being interpolated as a SQL identifier into `COUNT()`/`ORDER BY` (this also fixes the dead `switch($order_by)` on an undefined variable).
  - Reflected XSS: `lunaTools::raise_error_page()` now `htmlspecialchars()`-escapes the requested path before it reaches the response.
  - PHP object injection: cookies now use `json_encode`/`json_decode` instead of `serialize`/`unserialize`, and `lunaModel::load_request()` guards `unserialize()` against `O:`/`C:` object payloads.
  - `purgelogs` now requires `$_POST` (was triggerable by any GET, e.g. a forged `<img>`), so it can no longer wipe `luna_logs` via a forged link.
  - Log hygiene: `lunaLog::log()` stores only a small `$_SERVER` whitelist (remote addr, method, URI, host, UA, referer) instead of the whole array (which carried the cookie header and session id).
  - Session IP guard: `lunaTools::encode_ip()` no longer trusts the client-supplied `X-Forwarded-For`; it uses `REMOTE_ADDR`, closing the IP-spoof bypass of the session hijack check.
  - Login throttling: `mod_log::login()` now reads `login_attempts` and applies a capped per-account back-off (`sleep(min(attempts, 5))`); a correct password still resets the counter, so accounts are never permanently locked.
  - Deferred (more invasive, see security.md): CSRF tokens on every form, per-action authorisation re-checks, and session-ID rotation on login.

## [0.2.13-alpha] - 2026-06-18
- Fixed: `lunaModel::singleton()` guarded on `$this->$instance` (a variable-variable on an undefined name) in a method that is called statically, so the guard never saw the cached instance. Made it `static` and switched to `self::$instance`, matching `luna::singleton()` and `lunaSession::singleton()`.
- Fixed: `lunaModel::load_node()` array-relationship branch read `is_active` from the literal key `$node['is_activex']` instead of the computed key `$node[$is_active.($i+1)]` (`$is_activex`), so secondary related nodes never got their real `is_active` value.
- Fixed: `lunaTools::go()` redirect built its URL from an undefined `$alias` in the default branch, so the unauthorised-user redirect (`go('login')`) resolved to an empty alias instead of the login page. It now resolves `$where`, and `exit`s after sending the `Location` header so execution actually stops at the auth gate.
- Fixed: seed `luna_nodes_map` had a broken guest→group edge `(2, 3), (2, 3)` (forward duplicated, reverse missing); corrected to the symmetric pair `(2, 3), (3, 2)` used by every other edge. Affects fresh database imports only.

## [0.2.12-alpha] - 2026-06-18
- Docs: refreshed the `docs/` set after a full code read-through.
  - Fixed stale `luna.php` line-number anchors across `architecture.md`, `configuration.md`, `templating.md`, and `security.md` (they had drifted ~+8 to +11 lines after the timezone commit): `__construct` 190, `set_site_path` 314, `set_requested_path` 303, `load_mods` 381, `transform` 506, `load_ini` 625, `use_trans_sid` 33, stylesheet cascade 575-607.
  - Corrected behavioural descriptions: bootstrap's early steps `die()`/`trigger_error()` directly rather than throwing; `lunaLog::log()` screen-dumps **or** DB-writes (mutually exclusive); `OPTIMIZE TABLE` runs after *any* non-AJAX submit (not only successful ones) and `submit()` always runs before the mode switch; the AJAX short-circuit lives in `transform()`; `mod_journal` reads `luna_logs` (not `luna_actions`); `mod_admin::load()` only merges config; the model mutator list now includes `delete()`/`exists()`; documented the built-in (`luna.`-prefixed) vs domain-override (un-prefixed) stylesheet naming; noted `langs` is a single comma-separated string and `luna_logs.id` is the lone non-`unsigned` PK.
  - Security: corrected the `db.ini` guidance (it is gitignored and was never committed — rotate the on-disk credentials, nothing to untrack) and removed the inaccurate "cache files tracked" note. Added a verified "Additional findings (2026 code-review pass)" section (no CSRF, `mod_journal` `LIMIT` SQLi, session fixation, missing per-action authz, no login throttling, `unserialize()` object injection, reflected XSS in the error page, unescaped stored content, GET-triggered `purgelogs`, `$_SERVER` written to `luna_logs`, bypassable session guard).

## [0.2.11-alpha] - 2026-06-18
- Fixed: `date()` warning "It is not safe to rely on the system's timezone settings" on PHP 5.3+ when `date.timezone` is unset. The bootstrap now calls `date_default_timezone_set()` early, honouring an existing `php.ini` value and falling back to UTC.

## [0.2.10-alpha] - 2026-06-18
- Fixed: fatal `Call to undefined function: MDB2_Driver_mysql::raiseError()` on any database error path. The PHP image ships a newer system PEAR under `/usr/local/lib/php`, and `luna.lib` was *appended* to `include_path`, so MDB2 loaded the system `PEAR.php` (whose `raiseError` the bundled MDB2 cannot reach) instead of the bundled one. Now `luna.lib` is *prepended* so the bundled PEAR/MDB2/Log set always wins. This previously broke every insert/update (MDB2's id-sequence logic deliberately triggers and catches errors).

## [0.2.9-alpha] - 2026-06-18
- Fixed: schema failed to import on modern MySQL — `TYPE=MyISAM` → `ENGINE=MyISAM` (removed in MySQL 5.5)
- Fixed: fatal parse error on PHP 5.6 — duplicate `static` modifier on `lunaTools::parse_bbcode()`
- Changed: mask `E_DEPRECATED`/`E_STRICT` so the PHP 5.2/5.3-era idioms don't spam output on PHP 5.6
- Docker: repoint apt at `archive.debian.org` (Debian 9 "stretch" is off the main mirrors) and pin the `mysql:5.7` service to `linux/amd64`; drop the obsolete Compose `version` key
- Verified the full Docker stack boots, renders pages, serves the `xml`/`json`/`n3` RDF outputs, and authenticates the seed admin

## [0.2.8-alpha] - 2026-06-18
- Added a full technical documentation set under `docs/` (overview, architecture, RDF model, database schema, modules, templating, configuration, installation, security)
